        "content": "Online company reviews are high stakes.\n\nTop reviews on sites like Glassdoor and Google can get thousands of impressions each month and are major drivers of brand perception.\n\nEmployers know this. And when I come across multiple 5 star reviews left with no cons, or a Pulitzer worthy essay from a former intern, I become suspicious.\n\nThese reviews start to resemble 30 under 30 lists: so artificially constructed that you begin to question their credibility in the first place.\n\nThe scrutiny around company reviews is well documented; some companies file lawsuits worth over a million dollars to reveal anonymous reviewers that complain about their jobs.\n\nWhilst it's the flashy lawsuits that make the headlines, there also exists an underground economy of company reviews operating quietly every single day.\n\nIn this underground economy, some companies pay over $150 to freelancers to try and get a negative review removed. If they want \u201cbetter\u201d results, they go to the plethora of Online Reputation Management services (ORMs) in the United States that can charge retainers worth thousands of dollars.\n\nThe supply of positive reviews exists too. My research led me to find companies, including a prominent Y-Combinator backed startup, that solicit fake positive reviews from online freelancers to improve their rating.\n\nMany of these mercenary fake reviewers, often based in South East Asia, make a full time living doing this, netting over $2,000 per month.\n\nSome of these run such sophisticated operations that they\u2019ve even created their own pricing tiers (e.g $35 per original review, $20 to post an already created review from an email address), a la SaaS offering.\n\nOthers operate on a contingency fee agreement model, where they only get paid if they\u2019re able to take a negative review down.\n\nThe underground economy of company reviews is well and truly alive. And today we\u2019re going to find out how it operates.\n\n***Note***: For more content like this, [*subscribe*](https://www.careerfair.io/subscribe) *to my newsletter. In a couple of weeks, I'll be releasing my guide to writing a killer resume.*\n\n**Adding reviews**\n\nThe barriers to entry for adding fake reviews are much lower than for getting reviews removed, so that\u2019s where we\u2019ll start.\n\nTo write an employer review, all you really need is the ability to create an email address. For most sites, you don\u2019t need any proof of employment (say like a company specific email address).\n\nI went on a gig marketplace site and posted a pretty vague post related to wanting to find out more on how to improve a company\u2019s online presence.\n\nWithin minutes of posting a gig, my inbox was flooded with proposals:\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/esx3904qa20b1.png?width=3064&format=png&auto=webp&s=2ff3a2f8528fee99aabb830f27ea71a7569ebb2e\n\nAfter a bit of chatting, I narrowed the scope of their services and summarized their rates into the table below:\n\n|Channel|Cost|Timeline|Model|\n|:-|:-|:-|:-|\n|Freelancer #1|$10 per review|Monthly|Unlimited|\n|Freelancer #2|$35 per original review, $20 per already created review|Monthly|Unlimited|\n|Freelancer #3|$25 per review|Monthly|Unlimited|\n|Freelancer #4|$25 per review|Monthly|10 reviews|\n|Freelancer #5|$20 per review|Monthly|Unlimited|\n|Online Reputation Management Agency|$300 subscription|Monthly|8 reviews|\n\nLet\u2019s dive a bit deeper into the services that Freelancer #5 offered.\n\nFreelancer #5 explained to me he had been writing reviews for one particular company for the past 4 months now. Each month he wrote them 10 reviews.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/n1ddox6cb20b1.png?width=2684&format=png&auto=webp&s=5c271d0eec4328cb78d7d2cb85dfffa3f9eb72f8\n\nIn another message, he tells me he\u2019s offering the same services to 5 other companies. Doing some quick math:\n\n5 companies x 10 reviews per company x $25 per review = $1,250 per month\n\nConsidering the average person in Pakistan earns $150 per month, that\u2019s not bad change at all.\n\nOne of the companies that he\u2019s offering his services to includes a Y-Combinator backed startup. I won\u2019t name the company, but here\u2019s what its average Glassdoor review rating distribution looks like:\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/2np5b6fdb20b1.png?width=2420&format=png&auto=webp&s=f8cafaa85453b0933a18eb5c30f931b3bb893c46\n\n5 star reviews account for over 77% of the company\u2019s total reviews. Obviously, no one is buying fake reviews that make them look bad.\n\nBut here\u2019s the thing: freelancers are getting quite smart when it comes to writing reviews that don\u2019t look too fishy. They tend to do this by spacing the reviews out (so that they don\u2019t come in \u201cspikes\u201d \u2013 more on this later) and they also make sure that they\u2019re not always leaving the \u201ccons\u201d section blank.\n\nDon\u2019t get me wrong, if you come across this company\u2019s reviews, it\u2019d be pretty easy to tell they\u2019re quite strange. In fact, I can\u2019t even post some screenshots here because it\u2019d give the company away immediately.\n\nBut it would be challenging to conclude that the above company is buying reviews just by analyzing review volume and distribution without actually reading some of the reviews.\n\nThe same company is also buying reviews on Google Reviews.\n\nSidenote: I got curious about how he\u2019s been writing 50 reviews from 50 different emails per month. Would he actually create 50 different email addresses? And what about the IP address \u2013 doesn\u2019t Glassdoor flag multiple reviews from the same IP?\n\nOne of the freelancers answered my question:\n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/g4id2yqeb20b1.png?width=2572&format=png&auto=webp&s=c2a77fdea8834a6d90f02b8b3eb67b3a874f3df2\n\nMoving on \u2013 another company that seems to buy fake reviews seems to be having some more trouble. Approximately a month after a freelancer linked me to fake reviews he had written for this company, all five reviews that he had linked me to had been removed:\n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/99fdvcgfb20b1.png?width=3116&format=png&auto=webp&s=b7e244529fc62b5c824d925feb61fd2cc16cbfd5\n\nBased on this [Glassdoor webinar](https://youtu.be/3iy0JWOS1gs) from 2018, \u201cif it is found that a user has created multiple email accounts to submit reviews, then ALL submissions from that user are deleted\u201d \u2013 so likely Glassdoor\u2019s content moderation team flagged one of the initial reviews and the same freelancer who was writing reviews for that company had all the fake reviews deleted.\n\nSo far, it looks like the key to an effective fake review creation strategy lies in:\n\n* Spacing the fake reviews out\n* Writing each review from a different IP address (i.e benefit of being part of a team)\n* Using language that isn\u2019t an obvious giveaway\n\nOn that third point: the reality is that many of these freelancers\u2019 first language is not English.\n\nAs an experiment, I turned to everybody\u2019s favorite new toy, ChatGPT, and asked it to write me a positive Glassdoor review:\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/8w7cal9gb20b1.png?width=3164&format=png&auto=webp&s=860c39b11c5813e8b7fabdbb038d73c565cc98cf\n\nAnd I\u2019d say that the above answer was better than 95% of the fake reviews I came across.\n\n**Removing reviews**\n\nThe process for removing an employer review usually works like this:\n\n1. You identify one or multiple reviews that you want removed\n2. You verify whether the review violates the site's Guidelines, or whether there\u2019s something else about the review(s) that could get it removed.\n3. You file an appeal to get it removed.\n\nAs an example, Glassdoor\u2019s Review guidelines can be found [here](https://help.glassdoor.com/s/article/Community-Guidelines?language=en_US#:~:text=See%20More-,Review%C2%A0Guidelines,-Millions%20of%20job). Mainly, they forbid mentioning anyone by name who\u2019s not an executive and revealing proprietary or confidential information, amongst a host of other things.\n\nSounds simple enough right? Well, according to one of the freelancers I messaged:\n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/x6s8hsyac20b1.png?width=2036&format=png&auto=webp&s=f86c386f864198dc43faeb41faea378090c20107\n\nAfter some research, I summarized the different vendors and prices in the table below:\n\n&#x200B;\n\n|Channel|Cost|Timeline|Model|Self reported success rate|\n|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|\n|Freelancer #1|$100 per review|3 days|Contingency Agreement Model|100%|\n|Freelancer #2|$30 per review|7 days|Contingency Agreement Model|100%|\n|Reputation management service #2|$450 per review|21 business days|Contingency Agreement Model|Unknown|\n|Reputation management service #3|$1000 per review|Undefined|Contingency Agreement Model|100%|\n|Reputation management service #4 Plan 1|$550 per review|5-6 weeks|Contingency Agreement Model|50-75%|\n|Reputation management service #4 Plan 2|$300 Subscription + $100 per each review removed|Monthly service|Subscription plan|50-75%|\n|Freelancer #3|$20|Undefined|Pay regardless|Undefined|\n|Freelancer #4|$500|Undefined|Contingency Agreement Model|Undefined|\n\nAs you can see, unlike the fake review generation market, the prices vary quite a bit for getting reviews removed.\n\nAt one end, you have freelancers on gig marketplaces that will attempt to remove a review for less than $100. And then on the other end, you have ORMs (Online Reputation Management Agencies) that have multiple employees and more comprehensive packages in place. The one constant seems to be that most companies operate on a contingency agreement model (i.e pay only if review gets removed).\n\n**Analyzing reviews**\n\nReviewMeta is a site that analyzes Amazon reviews and tells you how many are legitimate. The creator of the site, Tommy Noonan, mentions in an [interview with NPR](https://www.npr.org/sections/money/2018/06/27/623990036/episode-850-the-fake-review-hunter) that the main giveaway that a product is soliciting fake reviews is:\n\n* A large, suspicious flood of positive reviews at the exact same time. For example, a 3 day stretch of time constituting 30% of total reviews.\n* Phrases and words that are constantly repeated, especially in the section with no cons\n* Brand monogamists (only review products from one company)\n\nWhilst the last two bullets are hard to track, the first can be used to analyze different companies\u2019 reviews and to check if there might be some funky business going on.\n\nAfter a couple of days, I have the ability to track review volume and review ratings over time for any company that I specify:\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/ehcbw2oje20b1.png?width=1653&format=png&auto=webp&s=b448ff35eb9878fbb1686de2fa8cf031e4ed3e05\n\nLet the games begin.\n\n## Voluntary Response Bias\n\nOne of the biggest challenges that review platforms face is the Voluntary Response bias.\n\nResearch shows many of today\u2019s most popular online review platforms (e.g Amazon) have a distribution of opinion that is highly polarized, with many extreme positive and/or negative reviews, and few moderate opinions.\n\nThink about it: have you ever felt moderately satisfied at your job and thought to yourself, now would be a great time to leave a Glassdoor review? Probably not.\n\nOn the other hand, if you\u2019ve had a terrible experience or even just had one thing really flip you off, you might be quite likely to leave an angry review.\n\nConsider when a company goes through layoffs. You\u2019re going to have a flood of angry reviews coming your way and are likely going to experience a \u201cspike\u201d in reviews.\n\n**Note:** Just like the Wall Street Journal\u2019s methodology described [here](https://archive.is/20201016094732/https://www.wsj.com/articles/companies-manipulate-glassdoor-by-inflating-rankings-and-pressuring-employees-11548171977#selection-3965.0-3968.0), I considered there to be a spike if the total number of reviews in the month was greater than three standard deviations above the mean of the surrounding months.\n\nLet\u2019s take the company below. Here\u2019s a graph of of their review volume since Jan 2020, including when they announced one of their first round of layoffs in June 2022:\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/n6kd9ejle20b1.png?width=3216&format=png&auto=webp&s=9eea2f3836617feca37eb88b1d3f67c8fa1b6fe2\n\nIn June 2022, approximately 19% of this company's 52 reviews were 1 star reviews (compared to an overall average of around 10%). This is what we could call a statistically significant spike in reviews. It also illustrates how the employees most likely to leave reviews are the ones that obviously had a bad experience (i.e getting laid off).\n\nHere\u2019s another company that had a similar spike in negative reviews due to layoffs in November 2022:\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/4vcnr1ine20b1.png?width=2408&format=png&auto=webp&s=f3877fb315ccc5d9a9294306a9f86616cb0fabd2\n\nThis company had an approximate 20% 1 star review rate (compared to an overall average of 12%) in November 2022, as well as an Avg Rating of 2.96 that month (compared to an overall average rating of 3.73).Unless HR is proactive, their reviews page risks succumbing to an echochamber of negative reviews that can really tilt one way.\n\n**Note:** Glassdoor does state (based on [this video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3iy0JWOS1gs) from 2017) that about 75% of the reviews on their platform are neutral. Their \u201cgive to get policy\u201d has helped in keeping the platform from becoming too polarized.\n\nI can understand why HR teams, like the ones that Nader talked to me about earlier, take a proactive stance towards managing their reviews. If they don\u2019t try to control their reputation themselves, then their reputation risks getting controlled by the employees that had the worst possible experience.\n\n## Goodhart\u2019s Law\n\nGoodhart\u2019s law states the following:\n\n*\"When a measure becomes a target, it ceases to be a good measure\"*\n\nEvery October, Glassdoor publishes their Best Places To Work ranking.\n\nIn a [report](https://www.wsj.com/articles/companies-manipulate-glassdoor-by-inflating-rankings-and-pressuring-employees-11548171977) that the WSJ did a couple of years ago, they found large spikes in the number of reviews that some companies (e.g SpaceX, Bain & Co, etc) got in September. The logic here is that some companies try to artificially inflate their Glassdoor reviews right before the October deadline.\n\nI decided to revisit some of this analysis with Glassdoor\u2019s 2023 Best Places To Work Ranking.\n\nOne of the companies I examined is rated as one of the best places to work in 2023. Let\u2019s refer to this company as FunPlaceToWork.\n\nHere is how their review volume looks like for all of 2022:\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/4e656zkqe20b1.png?width=2516&format=png&auto=webp&s=07141a66c56be7a6818efb9b1a4d912ee0021c91\n\nFunPlaceToWork got around 50 reviews in September 2022. Of those 50 reviews, 96% were 5 star reviews.\n\nFunPlaceToWork averaged 12 reviews per month up till then in 2022. Also, in the prior six months, the average percent of 5 star reviews received every month was \\~75%.\n\nBoth the spike in volume of reviews and the spike in percentage of five star reviews are statistically significant.\n\nI find it strange that Glassdoor\u2019s proprietary algorithm and/or Human Content Moderation team did not find a spike of this nature unusual. If we look at Glassdoor\u2019s eligibility criteria for the award, it\u2019s as follows:\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/hag04y7se20b1.png?width=2868&format=png&auto=webp&s=ec2b920e126a8ea42b40d35aaa55d5341e69d022\n\nThe goal, according to Glassdoor, is to collect \u201cauthentic and unbiased reviews\u201d.\n\nWhilst there\u2019s nothing against the rules for asking your employees to leave you reviews, I find the statistically significant spike of reviews at odds with the goal of collecting \"unbiased and authentic\" reviews (which Glassdoor states is the purpose of the awards).\n\nGlassdoor states that an employer is allowed to ask its employees to leave reviews, but that they are not allowed to \u201ccoerce\u201d them. Examples of what you can\u2019t do:\n\n* Offer incentives like Gift Cards in exchange for positive reviews.\n* Withholding their reference letter unless they leave you a positive review.\n* Anything that leads you to require proof for the employee to show you that they wrote a review.\n\nIt is possible to play by the rules (i.e not break any of the above rules) and to still in my opinion not collect authentic and unbiased reviews.\n\nThey say that you shouldn\u2019t hate the player but the game \u2013 I think **FunPlaceToWork** played by the rules, won fair and square, and that this is simply a perfect example of Goodhart\u2019s Law.\n\nI reached out to Glassdoor ([awards@glassdoor.com](mailto:awards@glassdoor.com)) about the above and this is the reply I got:\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/x0dqq39ue20b1.png?width=4800&format=png&auto=webp&s=c0102c963be9486370b340f2f473cbc6650fc48a\n\n**Conclusion**\n\nWhen I was 22, on an [F1 visa with 3 months to find work](https://www.careerfair.io/job-hunt-story), I didn\u2019t give a damn about bad reviews. I needed a job and I\u2019d sign any piece of paper you put in front of me.\n\nCompare that to someone at the peak of their career, someone with optionality and a multitude of job offers; an \u201cA-Player\u201d, as the experts call it, would absolutely have the luxury of choice and discard a job offer based on bad company reviews.\n\nFor most people, the impact of online company reviews lies somewhere in the middle. In marketing, there\u2019s a concept of a \u201cmarketing touchpoint\u201d - an interaction with the brand over the course of the whole buying journey.\n\nCompany reviews are one of the many touchpoints a job seeker experiences over their interview process. And with the technology industry booming the past couple of years, companies couldn\u2019t afford to slack on any touchpoints, including this one.\n\nAfter all, when others start to game the system, you\u2019re at a disadvantage if you don\u2019t. The rewards can be quite high. Certainly higher than just trying to be as transparent as possible.\n\nHR leaders are often more incentivized to inflate their metrics than to get honest feedback. Fake review writers have bills to pay. ORMs know that companies are desperate. And the platforms, well, aren\u2019t always paying attention.\n\nThe result is a potluck of interests that leads to an underground economy.\n\nOne that ends up hurting the job seeker.\n\n\\*\\*\\*\n\nWhew.

Or even better, trendline of average review score over time.\n\nAgain, well done and looking forward to more content.",

I am not a data scientist but engineer however I've been working on a dynamic pricing project where the client was all in on neural networks to predict product sales and figure out the best prices using overly complicated setup. They tried linear regression once, didn't work magic instantly, so they jumped ship to the neural network, which took them days to train.\n\nI thought, \"Hold on, let's not ditch linear regression just yet.\" Gave it another go, dove a bit deeper, and bam - it worked wonders. Not only did it spit out results in seconds (compared to the days of training the neural networks took), but it also gave us clear insights on how different factors were affecting sales. Something the neural network's complexity just couldn't offer as plainly.\n\nMoral of the story? Sometimes the simplest tools are the best for the job. Linear regression, logistic regression, decision trees might seem too basic next to flashy neural networks, but it's quick, effective, and gets straight to the point. Plus, you don't need to wait days to see if you're on the right track.\n\nSo, before you go all in on the latest and greatest tech, don't forget to give the classics a shot. Sometimes, they're all you need.\n\nCheers!\n\nEdit: Because I keep getting lot of comments why this post sounds like linkedin post, gonna explain upfront that I used grammarly to improve my writing (English is not my first language)",

I started looking for the posting, but couldn't find it, so I asked for a copy because my LinkedIn was getting attention indicating it existed somewhere.\n\nI expected this response if I had posted for a Data Scientist role, but I didn't. I posted for a Data Analyst.\n\nShe took it down. There were 255 applicants in less than 24 hours. She sifted through half of them, excluded those who weren't already authorized to work in the US and those who didn't show English proficiency through their resume, and then forwarded me 9. I don't know that the 9 was all of the viable candidates that remained, they did seem to be biased to areas we have a footprint in the US, and I had just requested a sample.\n\nOf those 9, 3 were absolutely new to the field. They put a data analytics certificate, but didn't even list which of the languages indicated on the posting they already knew. They didn't list any projects, just their previous work history (which was at best adjacent to the field). I looked up their certificates quickly and then moved on. List your technical skills - I'm not looking for \"good attitude, can learn\", I want to know how you've gotten yourself started in ways that are relevant to what I need. Your certificate only matters in what it taught you, not that you have it.\n\nI had 4 that were on point. They had the skills I had listed and then a few, and they either had relevant work experience or a history of coursework (online or through universities) that showed they would have a good framework to start from.\n\nTwo were overqualified. Their experience was legitimately as data engineers. I assume they actually read the posting, so they remain in consideration, but their skills are beyond the specifics I need. I can't justify paying them more unless I can find ways that benefit the org to use those extra skills. I assume they will drop themselves from consideration when we talk more, so if I were in a time crunch, I would cut them from my list. Wishful thinking on getting a unicorn isn't a good use of my time.\n\nI figured this was an opportunity for some perspective, seeing that we get \"what do I need to do to get a role\" posts all the time. I don't know what response I would have received if I had region locked this to around our HQ, or if we were offering hybrid or on-site work.\n\nJust to add - I am not accepting resumes through here. I'm also ignoring anyone who finds my or my coworkers' LinkedIns and sends us resumes outside the standard process. I've already seen those happen.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nEdit to add: I also considered projects in the \"on point\" group - they showed they applied the skills.\n\nUpdate: I checked with HR, the pay was included in the post. To be clear, it was mid-3rd quartile  for a Data Analyst position - we weren't posting anything with an amazing rate. It's very possible people submitted without reading the details, especially given the skill mismatches I see. I feel better about it, because I could not have written a more honest description of the role, so they had full information.\n\nAlso, 27 resumes were forwarded to me so far.

Do big companies ask for more information than small companies? What is it about websites like Workday that make them really hard to use?\n\nTo answer these questions, I applied to 250 jobs. One by one. Click by click. No Linkedin Easy Apply, no shortcuts \u2013 just straight from the careers page.\n\nI timed how long it took me to go from \u201capply to job\u201d to \u201csubmit application\u201d.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/adj6ge9jvyxb1.png?width=2820&format=png&auto=webp&s=2123533d9d04aabcdd5988471274ee2ed3b98704\n\nMake no mistake: I sacrificed my soul for this post. I created over 83 accounts and spent a total of 11 hours scrolling. I was originally going to do this for 500 companies, but wanted to chop my head off halfway.\n\nI did this for a mix of companies \u2013 Fortune 500 to early stage startups, spread out across different industries from software to manufacturing. The\u00a0*type*\u00a0of role I applied to was kept constant: engineering / product focused.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/ttn8yd1mvyxb1.png?width=2266&format=png&auto=webp&s=f27a52217e85bfade6eb30f0b696914eac7fc270\n\nThe outcome? An average of over two and a half minutes per application\u2014162 seconds of your life you'll never get back. But as we dig deeper, you'll discover that these 162 seconds only scratch the surface of an often maddening process.\n\n*Key Takeaways*\n\n* **Average Application Time:**\u00a0On average, it took a bit over two and a half minutes to apply to a job.\n* **Company Size Impact:**\u00a0If company size doubles, the application time increases by 5%. If company size increases by a factor of 10, then the app time increases by 20%.\n* **Industry Influence:**\u00a0Being a government company is the single largest determinant of a long application, followed closely by aerospace and consulting firms.\n* **Longest Application:**\u00a0The longest application time went to the United States Postal Service (10 minutes and 12 seconds).\n* **Shortest Application:**\u00a0On the other hand, It took me just 17 seconds to apply to Renaissance Technologies.\n* **ATS Impact:**\u00a0Older ATS like Workday and Taleo make job applications as much as 128% longer.\n\n**You can view the spreadsheet with the full raw data** [here](https://mailchi.mp/1a15a90c4aeb/company_raw_data_leadmagnet)\n\nLet's dive in.\n\n# The Setup\n\nThere\u2019s no real method to the 250 companies I pick. I\u2019m just typing names into Google and trying to vary it up. Where does Trisha work? What was that billboard I saw? It's all up for grabs.\n\nHere\u2019s the distribution of the 250 companies by size:\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/gv6r6xoqvyxb1.png?width=2420&format=png&auto=webp&s=6feb536781f5f892ff57aaed0033e716be4c25c4\n\nSome examples of companies in each range:\n\n* 1-500 \u2192 Glean, Quizlet, Gumroad\n* 500-5,000 \u2192 Notion, Dolby, Moloco\n* 5,000-50,000 \u2192 Airbnb, Genentech, Logitech\n* 50,000-100,000 \u2192 HP, American Express, Pfizer\n* 100,000+ \u2192 Wells Fargo, Lockheed Martin, General Motors\n\nAnd here\u2019s a look at the different types of industries represented:\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/j1nonh9tvyxb1.png?width=2372&format=png&auto=webp&s=2234a153954270bd3724029dac51cd270bfaf6ba\n\nI used a mix of Linkedin and Crunchbase for categorization.\n\nBefore we get started, if you\u2019d like you can read up on my\u00a0[methodology](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1A0I9_WBN9zIqwezM6OXqmOl3LPqaq5704EPmGDTDiYI/edit)\u00a0for applying to each job (aka assumptions I made, what data I chose to submit, and how much effort I put into each application).\n\n***Note***: For more content like this, [*subscribe*](https://www.careerfair.io/subscribe) *to my newsletter. In a couple of weeks, I'll be releasing my guide to writing a killer resume.*\n\n# What makes a job application so frustrating\n\nGenerally speaking, the more frustrating a job application, the longer it takes to complete.\n\nThe three main factors that might influence how long a job application is (as measured in my data):\n\n1. **Company size**\u00a0\u2192 I would expect bigger companies to ask more questions.\n2. **The ATS that is being used**\u00a0\u2192 I would expect clunkier, older ATS to make job applications longer.\n3. **Company industry**\u00a0\u2192 I would expect more \u201ctraditional\u201d industries to ask more questions.\n\nWe\u2019re going to model the relationship between the above three factors and the amount of time it takes to complete a job application. To do this, we\u2019re going to use a technique called linear regression.\n\nRegression is about the way two measurements change together. It can help us make predictions.\n\nFor example, if I add 10 employees to a company, how many seconds will that add to the company\u2019s job application process?\n\nSince we have other factors like ATS and Industry, we will also account for those. For now, though, let\u2019s just focus on each factor one by one.\n\n# Company Size\n\nLet\u2019s first plot the data as is:\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/sdvfivrzvyxb1.png?width=3276&format=png&auto=webp&s=37d9d55db8d0fef37d0365c523a0c1ba7e3e4199\n\nYes, I know, this isn\u2019t the most useful graph. I\u2019m going to spruce it up real quick, I promise.\n\nThe United States Postal Service has a job application that took over 10 minutes to complete. Navigating their portal felt like using Internet Explorer in 2003:\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/40iu1ni2wyxb1.png?width=1604&format=png&auto=webp&s=b7b65699a39f2e4e3c3abadf38875280a673a0d7\n\nNetflix\u2019s application was just 20 seconds - their only mandatory requirements are your resume and basic info.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/sl4fums4wyxb1.png?width=2310&format=png&auto=webp&s=4c0c87299460bd22163f34db1040a56ea3893059\n\nApple took me 71 seconds, still pretty fast for a company that has over 270,000 employees (PWC, which has a similar number of employees, took me almost six times as long).\n\nOkay, back to the chart. There are a couple of problems with it.\n\nFirst, the data is not linear. This is a problem if we want to use linear regression.\n\nSecond, the company size scale is hard to interpret because of the many data points clumped together near zero (representing all the smaller companies).\n\nWe can resolve both these issues with the following insight:\n\nThere is a big difference between going from 10 to 100 employees and, say, 10,000 to 10,100 employees. The first represents major changes in company structure: you might actually hire a proper HR team, a bunch of recruiters, and build out your candidate experience. The second, though, is pretty much just business as usual - think of a multinational opening up a satellite office or a regular month of hiring.\n\nSince we want to account for this, our data is better suited to a log scale than a linear scale. I will also transform our Y-axis, the application time, to a log scale because it helps normalize the data.\n\nIf we plot both our variables on a log-log scale, we get the below chart:\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/5l4po6d8wyxb1.png?width=4304&format=png&auto=webp&s=b3199197ea1b608fc39b8c3626ab994dc9d5eb5e\n\nBetter right? This is the same data as the last chart, but with different axes that fits the data better, we observe a linear relationship.\n\nWe have the usual suspects in the top right: Government organizations, professional services firms, and some of the tech industry dinosaurs.\n\nThe variance in application times across smaller companies, like startups, is interesting. For example, many of the startups with longer application times (e.g OpenAI, Posthog, Comma.AI) reference that they are looking for \u201cexceptional\u201d candidates on their careers page. (Note that OpenAI has changed its application since I last analyzed it - it\u2019s now much faster, but when I went through they asked for a mini essay on why you\u2019re exceptional).\n\nOne thing that I was expecting to see was competitors mirroring each other\u2019s application times. This is most closely represented with the consulting firms like Deloitte, E&Y, KPMG, etc all clumped together. McKinsey and Bain, the two most prestigious consulting firms, have applications that take longer to complete.\n\nThis doesn\u2019t necessarily seem to be the case with the FAANG companies.\n\nWe can also calculate the correlation coefficient for this graph. This is a statistical measure of the strength of a linear relationship between two variables. The closer to 1 the value, the stronger the relationship.\n\nFor the above data, we get a correlation coefficient of 0.58, which is a moderate to strong association.\n\nNote that on its own, this doesn't tell us anything about causation. But it does start to point us in some type of direction.\n\nIt's not rocket science: big companies ask for more stuff. Sometimes they ask for the last 4 digits of your SSN.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/c7g5717bwyxb1.png?width=1512&format=png&auto=webp&s=38c776e46d45d179a6627ba3470fd4f89ca04204\n\nSometimes they even ask if you\u2019d be okay going through a polygraph:\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/1q52rzldwyxb1.png?width=400&format=png&auto=webp&s=b3b8921e055d38e04ee7395e9b982fa50c38f9df\n\nAn argument here is that if big companies didn\u2019t have some sort of barriers in their application process, they\u2019d get swarmed with applications.\n\nConsider the fact that Google gets 3 million applications every year. Deloitte gets 2 million. Without some sort of initial friction in the application process, those numbers would be even higher. That friction almost serves as a reliable filter for interest.\n\nIf you\u2019re an employer, you don\u2019t really care about the people using a shotgun approach to apply. You want the candidates that have a real interest in the position. On the other hand, if you\u2019re a candidate, the reality is such that the shotgun approach to apply is arguably the most efficient.\n\nSo we have this inherent tension between companies and candidates. Candidates want the most bang for their buck, companies don\u2019t want thousands of irrelevant resumes.\n\nAnd in the middle, we have the plethora of application tracking software that can often be quite old and clunky.\n\n# ATS\n\nEverytime I came face to face with a company that used Workday as their ATS, I died a bit inside. This is because Workday makes you:\n\n1. create a new account every single time\n2. redirects you away from the careers page\n\nI defined a redirect as one when the job description is not listed on the same page as the first input box part of the application.\n\nThis isn\u2019t a perfectly accurate measure, but it does allow us to differentiate between the modern ATS like Greenhouse and older ones like Workday.\n\nWith every ATS, I implicitly had some type of \u201chow easy is this going to be\u201d metric in my head.\n\nWe can try to represent this \u201chow easy is this going to be\u201d metric a bit more concretely using the matrix below.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/bvpeu47iwyxb1.png?width=2200&format=png&auto=webp&s=818191eb4a0a5924c582f3ad7ec9539bc510f6fa\n\nIdeally, you want the ATS to be in the bottom left corner. This creates an experience that is low friction and fast.\n\nIf we plot application time versus ATS, this is what we get:\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/pe9zyxmkwyxb1.png?width=3184&format=png&auto=webp&s=8df5c1118f9f0044e2154c8ae63816332ca42d67\n\nThe ATS that don\u2019t make you create an account and don\u2019t redirect you are tied to lower application times than the ones that do.\n\nOne possibility is that certain companies are more likely to use certain ATS. Big companies might use Workday for better compliance reporting. Same with the industry - maybe B2C software companies use the newer ATS on the market. These would be confounding variables, meaning that we may misinterpret a relationship between the ATS and the application time when in fact there isn\u2019t one (and the real relationship is tied to the industry or size).\n\nSo to properly understand whether the ATS actually has an effect on application time, we need to control for our other variables. We\u2019ll do this in the final section when we run a regression including all our variables.\n\nOne of the big frustrations surrounding different ATS is that when you upload your resume, you then need to retype out your experience in the boxes because the ATS resume parser did it incorrectly. For example, I went to UC Berkeley but sometimes got this:\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/ay21vccnwyxb1.png?width=928&format=png&auto=webp&s=9862b0860c49c87a76b02218f8e4118134acfb89\n\nThe only resume parser that didn't seem abysmal was the one from Smart Recruiters. TikTok's resume parser also isn't bad.\n\nAnother frustrating experience is tied to inconsistency between the company I'm applying to and the ATS.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/9xzq21vpwyxb1.png?width=350&format=png&auto=webp&s=8432b293be4db0f58770760097df0117b53e667e\n\nA company\u2019s application process is often the first touchpoint you have with their brand. Startups competing for the best talent can't afford extra steps in their process. Apple and Facebook can.\n\nWhilst the average time to complete a job application may only be 162 seconds, the fact that many ATS require steps like account creation and authentication can lead to application fatigue.\n\nIt\u2019s not necessarily the explicit amount of time it takes, it\u2019s the steps involved that drain you of energy and make you want to avoid applying to new jobs.\n\n# Industry\n\nOkay, so far we\u2019ve looked at company size and the ATS as a loose indicator of what might make a job application frustrating. What about the company industry?\n\nYou would expect industries like banking or professional services to have longer application times, because getting those jobs revolves around having a bunch of credentials which they likely screen for (and ask you to submit) early on in the process.\n\nOn the other hand, internet startups I\u2019d expect to be quick and fast. Let\u2019s find out if this is true.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/i7825ssvwyxb1.png?width=4012&format=png&auto=webp&s=3f51989a663cf7b8c664eacb983a9be0a8dbc80b\n\nHyped up industries like AI and Crypto have shorter application times. As expected, banks and consulting firms care about your GPA and ask you to submit it.\n\nA government company has to basically verify your identity before they can even receive your application, so the process is entirely different and reflected in the submission time.\n\nFor many technology companies, the application process is almost like an extension of the company\u2019s brand itself. For example, Plaid (an API first Fintech company), has a neat option where you can actually apply to the job via API:\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/px5k5wwxwyxb1.png?width=720&format=png&auto=webp&s=d669e7e47e77e51d48a4867a2d06d27125617ed8\n\nRoblox, a gaming company, allows people to submit job applications from within their [games](https://gamerant.com/roblox-company-interview-job-applicants-in-game/).\n\nWe also notice differences between legacy companies and their newer competitors. If we compare legacy banks versus neobanks (like Monzo, Mercury, etc), the legacy players averaged around 250 seconds per job application whereas the neobanks averaged less than 60 seconds.\n\nIf you can\u2019t compete on prestige, you need to find other ways. One of those ways can be through asking for less information upfront.\n\n# Putting it together\n\nNow that we've analyzed each variable - the company size, ATS, and the industry - to understand the separate relationship of each to application time, we can use linear regression to understand the *combined* relationships.\n\nThis will allow us to determine what factors actually have an impact on the job application time versus which ones might just have had one when we looked at them in isolation.\n\nAfter some number crunching in R, I get the following results (I\u2019ve only added the statistically significant factors \u2013 the ones with the \u201cstrongest evidence\u201d):\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/g2pg1o11xyxb1.png?width=2496&format=png&auto=webp&s=2efc92ad2cfa4aaf25297d23c228d0c7343729f9\n\nHere\u2019s how you can interpret some of the information above:\n\n* When a job app is for a company that is within the Government industry, the submission time goes up by 366% (assuming the size and ATS are constant). For the aerospace industry, this is 249% (and so on).\n* When a job app is for a company using the Workday ATS, the submission times goes up by 128% (assuming the size and industry are constant). For the Phenom ATS, this is 110% (and so on).\n* Our only (statistically significant) metric which seems to make job applications faster is the Lever ATS (42% shorter).\n\nOkay, now what about company size?\n\nWell, first up: company size is indeed statistically significant. So there is an effect.\n\nHowever, its effect is not as strong as most of our other variables. To be precise, here are some ways to interpret our company size coefficient:\n\n* If company size doubles, the app size increases by 5%\n* If company size increases by a factor of 10, then the app time increases by 20%\n\nThis is a smaller effect size compared to ATS or industry (a 20% increases in app time for a 10x large company is a qualitatively smaller effect size than e.g. a 100% increase in app time for Taleo ATS). So although company size is statistically significant, it is not as strong of a driver as ATS and industry of app time.\n\n# Wrapping it up\n\nTwo and a half minutes might not be too long, but it can feel like an eternity when you\u2019re forced to answer the same questions and upload the same documents. Over and over again.\n\nThink about catching a flight. All you want is to get on the jet. Hawaii awaits.\n\nBut first: the security line. You have to take your shoes off. You get patted down and your bag gets searched. The gate numbers don\u2019t make sense. And then at the end of it, your flight\u2019s delayed. Congrats.\n\nApplying to a job can feel similar. All you want to do is say aloha to the hiring manager, a real human being.\n\nTo even have the remote possibility of making that happen, you need to create an account and password, check your email, retype your entire resume, tell them the color of your skin, and explain why this company you\u2019ve never heard of before is the greatest thing on Earth.\n\nAnd for what? Most likely for the privilege of receiving an automated email about two weeks later rejecting you.\n\nIf we make it tiring and unappealing to look for new opportunities, then we prevent people from doing their best work.\n\nBut what would a world where applying took just a few seconds actually look like? Recruiters would get bombarded with resumes. It's possible to argue that job applications taking so long is a feature, not a bug. You get to filter for intent and narrow down your application pool.\n\nIs it fair to shift the burden of screening unqualified candidates onto good candidates that now need to provide so much information? Shouldn\u2019t that burden fall on the recruiter?\n\nThe truth is that applying to a job via the careers page is a bit of a rigged game. The odds are not in your favor.\n\nSometimes, though, all you need is to only be right once.\n\n\\*\\*\\*\n\nIf you made it all the way to the bottom, you're a star. This took a while to write.

        "content": "I was part of an interview panel for a staff data science role. The candidate had written a really impressive resume with lots of domain specific project work experience about creating and deploying cutting-edge ML products. They had even mentioned the ROI in millions of dollars. The candidate started talking endlessly about the ML models they had built, the cloud platforms they'd used to deploy, etc. But then, when other panelists dug in, the candidate could not answer some domain specific questions they had claimed extensive experience for. So it was just like any other interview.\n\nOne panelist wasn't convinced by the resume though. Turns out this panelist had been a consultant at the company where the candidate had worked previously, and had many acquaintances from there on LinkedIn as well. She texted one of them asking if the claims the candidate was making were true. According to this acquaintance, the candidate was not even part of the projects they'd mentioned on the resume, and the ROI numbers were all made up. Turns out the project team had once given a demo to the candidate's team on how to use their ML product.\n\nWhen the panelist shared this information with others on the panel, the candidate was rejected and a feedback was sent to the HR saying the candidate had faked their work experience.\n\nThis isn't the first time I've come across people \"plagiarizing\" (for the lack of a better word) others' project works as their's during interview and in resumes. But this incident was wild. But do you think a deserving and more eligible candidate misses an opportunity everytime a fake resume lands at your desk? Should HR do a better job filtering resumes?\n\nEdit 1: Some have asked if she knew the whole company. Obviously not, even though its not a big company. But the person she connected with knew about the project the candidate had mentioned in the resume. All she asked was whether the candidate was related to the project or not. Also, the candidate had already resigned from the company, signed NOC for background checks, and was a immediate joiner, which is one of the reasons why they were shortlisted by the HR. \n\nEdit 2: My field of work requires good amount of domain knowledge, at least at the Staff/Senior role, who're supposed to lead a team. It's still a gamble nevertheless, irrespective of who is hired, and most hiring managers know it pretty well. They just like to derisk as much as they can so that the team does not suffer. As I said the candidate's interview was just like any other interview except for the fact that they got caught. Had they not gone overboard with exxagerating their  experience, the situation would be much different.",

        "content": "With Pandas 2.0, no existing code should break and everything will work as is. However, the primary update that is subtle is the use of Apache Arrow API vs. Numpy for managing and ingesting data (using methods like read\\_csv, read\\_sql, read\\_parquet, etc). This new integration is hope to increase efficiency in terms of memory use and improving the usage of data types such string,  datatime, and categories.  \n\n\n>Python data structures (lists, dictionaries, tuples, etc) are very slow and can't be used. So the data representation is not Python and is not standard, and an implementation needs to happen via Python extensions, usually implemented in C (also in C++, Rust and others). For many years, the main extension to represent arrays and perform operations on them in a fast way has been NumPy. And this is what pandas was initially built on.  \n>  \n>While NumPy has been good enough to make pandas the popular library it is, it was never built as a backend for dataframe libraries, and it has some important limitations.\n\n**Summary of improvements include:**\n\n* **Managing missing values:** By using Arrow, pandas is able to deal with missing values without having to implement its own version for each data type. Instead, the Apache Arrow in-memory data representation includes an equivalent representation as part of its specification\n* **Speed:** Given an example of a dataframe with 2.5 million rows running in the author's laptop, running the `endswith` function is 31.6x fasters using Apache Arrow vs. Numpy (14.9ms vs. 471ms, respectively)\n* **Interoperability:** Ingesting a data in one format and outputting it in a different format should not be challenging. For example, moving from SAS data to Latex, using Pandas <2.0 would require:\n   * Load the data from SAS into a pandas dataframe\n   * Export the dataframe to a parquet file\n   * Load the parquet file from Polars\n   * Make the transformations in Polars\n   * Export the Polars dataframe into a second parquet file\n   * Load the Parquet into pandas\n   * Export the data to the final LATEX file  \nHowever, with PyArrow, the operation can be as simple as such (after Polars bug fixes and using Pandas 2.0):\n\n&#8203;\n\n    loaded_pandas_data = pandas.read_sas(fname) \n    \n    polars_data = polars.from_pandas(loaded_pandas_data) \n    # perform operations with pandas polars \n    \n    to_export_pandas_data = polars.to_pandas(use_pyarrow_extension_array=True) to_export_pandas_data.to_latex()\n\n* **Expanding Data Type Support:**\n\n>Arrow types are broader and better when used outside of a numerical tool like NumPy. It has better support for dates and time, including types for date-only or time-only data, different precision (e.g. seconds, milliseconds, etc.), different sizes (32 bits, 63 bits, etc.). The boolean type in Arrow uses a single bit per value, consuming one eighth of memory. It also supports other types, like decimals, or binary data, as well as complex types (for example a column where each value is a list). There is [a table](https://pandas.pydata.org/docs/dev/reference/arrays.html?highlight=arrowdtype#pyarrow) in the pandas documentation mapping Arrow to NumPy types.\n\n[https://datapythonista.me/blog/pandas-20-and-the-arrow-revolution-part-i](https://datapythonista.me/blog/pandas-20-and-the-arrow-revolution-part-i)",

But we have frequent meetings with other people in our field, data scientists, engineers, architects, etc. They are all back in office 4 days a week, and each of them has this ashy tone, they grudgingly hate being in the office, despise it, because who wants to go to a stuffy office?\n\n\nHere are the top complaints that I have noticed from people about being in office\n\n- The commute is terrible. Some people have to commute as much as 50 minutes one way, and that's not including traffic. That's crazy. You're not getting paid for that. That's free labor and travel for your company\n\n\n- The office is incredibly distracting. Cubicles are typically open, so people can freely walk up and talk to you, make eye contact with you which starts a conversation, but you're still under the same time crunch you were when you worked from home completely isolated in your nice office away from everyone else\n\n\n- \"Collaborative spaces\" and \"focus areas\" are bullsh*t. So many nice little desks, nooks, rooms for you to go to to focus or meet with others. But here's the thing, you never see anyone using those because I guess where they are? At their desk, working, constantly. No one ever has the time to use them. My office is so incredibly nice, and every time I walk around, I feel like I'm the only one taking a walk because I see everyone glued to their desks\n\n- You're distracted constantly by others who are at different levels than you. The only way I figured out that there is some college intern making twice as much as I am doing a little bit more than me is by speaking to people in the immediate vicinity of my desk. Machine learning engineer versus data scientist. The difference? They use a little bit more power platform, a couple more tools, 20 more lines of Python a day. Congrats, here is 40K more for you. This can be very distracting, because you see these people all the time\n\n\n- NO PRODUCTIVITY OR OTHER GAIN. Literally no benefit or gain from being back in the office. Just disgruntled people\n\n\n- office supplies are shit. At home, I have an ultra wide monitor that I also use for personal PC gaming so I can just literally KVM switch it over. I have a modded gaming mouse and keyboard, a $200 Logitech pro headset with superior sound quality and microphone. You know what I don't have at the office? Any of this stuff. Yeah. A $5 Logitech mouse and keyboard that is extremely noisy and uncomfortable has no ergonomics at all. Office chairs are not ergonomic They are just the cheapest they could get. Uncomfortable $0.90 headsets and webcams\n\n\n- MANDATORY extracurricular events and activities in or outside of work. Yes, this is real. After hours socials, restaurants, social outings. These are disguised as optional, but you will often get bullied teased or pressured into them. This also does not grant you any leeway during any project, you still have to get all work and projects done with this loss of time",

I won't mention the institution name or location, though I think this is something typical across all non-prestigious universities. Basically, master's courses in data science, especially those of 1 year and marketed to international students, are a scam. \n\nEssentially, because there is pressure to pass all the students, we cannot give any material that is too challenging. I don't want to put challenging material in the course because I want them to fail--I put it because challenge is how students **grow** and **learn**. Aside from being a data analyst, being even an entry-level data scientist requires being good at a lot of things, and knowing the material deeply, not just superficially. Likewise, data engineers have to be good software engineers.\n\nBut apparently, asking the students to implement a trivial function in Python is too much. Just working with high-level libraries won't be enough to get my students a job in the field. OK, maybe you don\u2019t have to implement algorithms from scratch, but you have to at least wrangle data. The theoretical content is OK, but the practical element is far from sufficient.\n\nIt is my belief that only one of my students, a software developer, will go on to get a high-paying job in the data field. Some might become data analysts (which pays thousands less), and likely a few will never get into a data career.\n\nUniversities write all sorts of crap in their marketing spiel that bears no resemblance to reality. And students, nor parents, don\u2019t know any better, because how many people are actually qualified to judge whether a DS curriculum is good? Nor is it enough to see the topics, you have to see the *assignments*.

After weeding out programs that were a bad fit or didn't look serious, all of the remaining possibilities require courses in statistics and SQL.  I'd have to look again, but I don't think any of them are advertised as 1 year programs.  I can't speak to whether they make you solve real programming problems or not at this point.\n\nSo, this raises 2 questions for me:\n\n1.  What do you consider to be a prestigious university and where's the cutoff before it becomes too undistinguished, and therefor a scam in your opinion?\n2. If the university isn't prestigious by your definition, but they do require significant coursework in statistics and SQL, and aren't advertised as 1 year programs, how likely are they to be a scam?",

        "content": "Broadly speaking, the job of a data scientist is to use data to understand things, create value, and inform business decisions. It it *not necessarily* to implement and utilize advanced Machine Learning and Artificial Intelligence techniques. That's not to say that you can't or won't use ML/AI to inform business decisions, what I'm saying is that it's not always required to. Obviously this is going to depend on your company, their products, and role, but let's talk about a quintessential DS position at a quintessential company.\n\nI think the problem a lot of newer or prospective Data Scientists run into is that they learn all these advanced techniques and want to start using them right away. They apply them anywhere they can, kind of shoehorning them in and not having a clear idea of what it is they are even trying to accomplish in the first place. In other words, the tools lead the problem. Of course, the way it should be is that the problem leads the tools. I'm coming to find for like 50+% of the things I'm asked to do, a time series visualization, contingency tables, and histograms are sufficient to answer the question to the satisfaction of the business leaders. That's it. We're done, on to the next one. Start simple, if the simple techniques don't answer the question, then move on to the more advanced stuff. I speak from experience, of course.\n\nIn my opinion, understanding when to use simple tools vs when to break out the big guns is way harder then figuring out how to use the big guns. Even harder still is taking your findings and translating them into actual, actionable insights that a business can use. Okay, so you built a multi-layer CNN that models customer behavior? That's great, but what does the business do with it? For example, can you use it to identify customers who might buy more product with more advertising? Can you put a list of those customers on the CEO's desk? Could a simple regression model have done the same in 1/4 of the time? These are skills that take years to learn and so it's totally understandable for newer or prospective DSs to not have them. But they do not seem to be emphasized in a lot of degree programs or MOOCs. It seems to me like they just hand you a dataset and tell you what to do with it. It's great that you can use the tools they tell you to on it, but you're missing out on the identifying which tools to even use part in the first place.\n\nJust my 2c. \n\n&#x200B;",

            "The harsh truth is that it wasn\u2019t always like that\u2026 Here is a brief history of the data science title and how it shifted. TLDR at the bottom. \n\nWhat is the difference between a data scientist today and a statistical analyst of yesterday? Not much, maybe data scientists use python now and Jupyter notebooks instead of R and markdown files. But the original vision for the data scientist as described by Harvard\u2019s infamous article describing data science as the sexiest job was not just a rebranding of a statistical analyst. \n\nData science made its debut in product. The product was always the algorithm that helped automate decision making. Recommender systems, translation, most recently chat bots. These are the things that originally got us excited about data science when we were laymen. Even in the infamous article \u201cData Scientist: the Sexiest Job if the 21st Century,\u201d they primarily use the Linkedin recommender system as the tool that revolutionized the business. A product - not a report, not a stakeholder meeting, etc. \n\nWhen the decision scientist title existed, data science was still about predictive analytics. Decision scientists have effectively been swallowed by the data science brand as expectations of what data scientists should do shifted. This impacted the field turning data science into a primarily product geared position, to more of a consultant. This is what caused the huge expectation for data scientists to revolutionize business by looking at the data and uncovering hidden trends that would give business x a huge competitive advantage and blow the rest of the competition in the dust. That\u2019s why companies use to be willing to pay so much money for a data scientist. We all know, for the vast majority of companies\u2026 it didn\u2019t work out that way. \n\nBefore the ML Engineer title existed, data scientists were the ML guys. ML use to be the very core of data science and what differentiated them from traditional analysts. It was forward looking more than backward looking. Facebooks data science \u2018core\u2019 team use to require research degrees in CS and/or Statistics to be in this core team. Other companies were less restrictive, but their core data scientists also researched and applied machine learning methodologies. It wasn\u2019t until Lyft entered the business that core data scientists began rebranding themselves as machine learning engineers and data science became more focused on analysis than product.\n\nIn 2018 Lyft singlehandedly changed the data science landscape. One if Lyfts core problems when hiring analytical staff was that due to the insane hype around data science, everyone was calling themselves a data scientist whether or not they had the skills to understand and apply machine learning. Lyft noticed that when they rebranded their unpopular BI roles as data scientists, these class of people that knew nothing about predictive analysis but called themselves data scientists would apply for these roles at mass. (They got paid more too given the new title) And those were exactly the type of people that Lyft needed. You know excel and can make some visualizations on tableau? Great welcome to the data science team. Now the data science umbrella composed mainly of BI analysts, data analysts, core data scientists, and everything in between. I believe at this time the Chief Data Scientist of some tech company infamously changed his instagram handle to read \u2018Machine Learning Engineer\u2019 to differentiate himself from the new trend of what data science was becoming. \n\nHow did this happen? Well, we\u2019ve all been there or heard this story. You get onboarded as a data scientist at a company, the CEO has created a whole data science team, everyone can make a dashboard, everyone knows excel. There is no data engineering team, no product, no path forward. That is why the CEO hired so many data scientists anyway, to uncover his businesses future. Next month, and hundreds of thousands of dollars later the entire team is gutted, the CEO is fired, and the company is restarting their data practice from the bottom up starting with data engineers and software engineers. Can\u2019t code? You\u2019re not in. Can\u2019t build products you\u2019re not in. You\u2019re on the data science team? Great, how are those KPIs looking this month? Expectations of what data science was supposed to be were way too high. Data Scientists were expected to be business magicians and lead companies next to business leaders. Some did, most didn\u2019t. Now people have a more realistic perspective for the data science role as a non revolutionary analyst type role.\n\nWho\u2019s to blame and what\u2019s the lesson? \nNo one\u2019s to blame, this is the hype cycle that has existed with every new thing in business. There\u2019s a whole \u2018Gen AI\u2019 hype right now where everyone thinks AI is a chatbot. Maybe this is a cautionary tale to business leaders and aspiring data professionals to dig deeper beyond the hype so you\u2019re not left disillusioned. \n\nTL:DR;\nData science teams were mainly product focused machine learning teams until Lyft changed the landscape and rebranded their BI Analysts as Data Scientists. This rebranding was good for Lyft, but left many smaller companies disillusioned with Data Scientists as they began hiring BI Analyst types with the expectations that data science will revolutionize their company to become industry leaders. Those who pioneered advancements in machine learning under the data scientist title have rebranded themselves as machine learning engineers to differentiate themselves. Now the data science role is a non extraordinary analyst type role. Be careful around hype cycles so you too are not left disillusioned.",

But I have never really done data science before in my life and I'm a little worried about going in there and just complete flopping. My statistics teacher made the class wayyyy too easy so I'm really going in with only a little knowledge. I barely know what a standard deviation is.\n\nI have worked on projects as an intern software developer where I built a tool which helps people who do data analysis but I don't actually know how to do any of it myself. I think the hiring manager was more impressed with what I can do in software development, but the job description was tons of what looks like traditional DS stuff.\n\nJust wondering if anybody had any ideas on what I should be focusing on to improve upon my weak points? I have a BS in CS.\n\nSkills: python, using LLMs, full stack swe, a bit of pandas, beautifulsoup, databases, sql\n\nLacking: actual data science skills\n\nSide note: how are the opportunities for remote work in DS as compared to software development?",

            "Years ago the DS title became over hyped and everyone and their mother wanted it for a while, but they also didn't want to do DS work, so companies got clever with it.  What if they hired people under the DS title but they do non DS work and are paid less than their proper title?  And guess what?  It worked!  Today we have data engineers, infrastructure engineers, cloud engineers, machine learning engineers, business analysts, data analysts, and more all with the data science title.\n\nSo to answer your question: The job title at this point is pointless.  What's important is figuring out what the company wants you to do and either doing it or learning how to do it and then doing it.  It sounds like they want you to do data or infrastructure engineering, or maybe creating tools for other data scientists.  Either way, it will probably be right up your ally given your previous experience.  I hope you enjoy it.",

        "content": "I have been a freelance Data Scientist for 6 month and I have more job offers than I can manage (I turn down offers every week). \n\nSome people have written me to get some tips on how to start and get some clients. \nSo these are a few things I tried to find clients on Upwork, LinkedIn and in online communities.\n\n1) Look for projects on Upwork. \nSet up a nice profile, showcase your project portfolio, research the market, bid on several projects and be willing to set a cheap rate at the beginning. \nYou won't make much money the first month, but you will get exposure, your Upwork rating will improve and you can start to bid on some higher paying jobs. \nIn 6 months my rate went up 4 times, so don't think it takes so long to get to a good hourly rate. \n\n2) Improve and polish your LinkedIn profile. \nMany recruiters will write you here. \nInsert the right keywords on your profile, document your previous work, post something work related every week, if you can. \nThis is a long game but pays off because instead of bidding for jobs, in the end the recruiters will start to write you.\n\n3) Join online communities of entrepreneurs.\nThere are several small businesses that look for Data experts and beyond. They have projects ongoing and want to hire freelancers for a short time. \nYou can meet them in these communities. Look for them on Twitter, Discord, Slack, Reddit...\nEngage with them, share what you do and soon you will start to get some interest. This type of interaction quickly turns into job opportunities.\n\n4) Write. \nJust create a blog and post regularly. Post about what you do, the tools you have used and so on. Better to post a tutorial, a new tech you tried out, a small model you developed. \nAll the successful people I know have this habit. They write and share what they do regularly.\n\n5) Put yourself out there and interact online. \nMaybe one day you share something and it gets retweeted, maybe you pick up a good SEO keyword in your blog, you never know. That's why it's important to increase your exposure. You will increase your chances of getting noticed and potentially land a new client.\n\n6) Be generous \nOnce you do the above soon you will be noticed and people will start to contact you. \nThey will not offer you a contract. That's not how it works. after all, they don't know you and they don't trust you. But something you wrote hit them. Probably they will ask for your help and advice on a specific issue. \nGive advice on the tech to use, how to solve a problem, how to improve their processes, give as much as you can, be honest and open. Say all you know and you will build trust. \nIt's the start of a professional relationship.\n\n7) Be patient\nNot all conversations will turn into a job opportunity. Sometimes they lead nowhere, sometimes there is no budget, sometimes it takes months to sign a contract. In my experience maybe 2-3 out of 10 conversations turn into a job offer. \nAccept it. It's normal.\n\nI have published more details about it in an article in [my blog](https://www.tropianhs.com/diary/2023/11/12/data-science-freelance).\n\nI often write about my freelance experience in Data Science on [Twitter](https://twitter.com/tropianhs).",

They were interested, I was in a good position as being able to advise them. The CEO got to know me. The executives were asking my advice and we were coming up with some cool genuine use cases that had legs. However, now they are just trying to shoehorn gen AI wherever they can for the sake of the investors. They are not making rational decisions anymore. They aren't even asking me about it anymore. Some exec wakes up one day and has a crazy misguided idea about sticking gen AI somewhere and then asking junior (non DS) devs to build it without DS input. All the while, traditional ML is actually making the company money, projects are going well, but getting ignored. Does this sound familiar? Do the execs get over it and go back to traditional ML eventually, or do they go crazy and start sacking traditional data scientists in favour of hiring prompt engineers?",

We already know the exact answer, word by word, that we want to give to the costumer. We only needed to replace a few specific data in the template, like the ticket_id and their address.\n\nWe now turned this template into a prompt instruction for ChatGPT, so it generates an answer that is close to what we expected in the template.\n\nNow, here comes the obvious question: if we want ChatGPT to give an answer as close as possible to our template, why not use it the template at all?\n\nThe answer: because we NEED to use GenAI.",

Presentation is half the battle. It doesn't need to look complicated, just make it nice and neat. I got my templates from here: https://html5up.net/\n\n- Try to make a project that is an \"end to end\" solution for something. \n\n- show some flair in your projects by doing something that interests you (mine was videogames, project #1), it shows personality\n\n- one thing that the hiring manager said that stuck with me: \"I'd rather hire someone passionate with personality than someone who  looks great on paper but has no teamwork skills or social skills (all other things being equal)\"",

They essentially buy and flip companies like a real estate investor buys and flips houses. They've recently (in the past few years) spun up a data science org. My understanding is that the responsibilities of this role would entail assisting the deal team in commercial due diligences of prospective investments, assisting in portfolio operations and consulting on advanced analytics for the portfolio companies, as well as company wide data science initiatives. My impression was that this role would not be very involved in deal sourcing.\n\n# My Background\n\n* FAANG Senior DS\n* Worked in management consulting in the past - primarily as a data science consultant for Silicon Valley tech companies but also did a commercial due diligence project with our M&A practice as a DS consultant\n* Ivy League masters in CS / Top 20 undergrad\n\n# Application Process & Experience\n\n* I first cold applied online\n* After a short period of time I received an email from a Carlyle recruiter with a link to a 2 hour Hackerrank exam. I did not first receive any introductory call or even an introductory email - just an email with a URL to Hackerrank.\n* I decided to take the exam. It consisted of:\n   * One SQL (medium / window functions)\n   * One Python (leetcode easy)\n   * Discrete probability (e.g. probability of making a full house if you randomly draw 5 cards from a standard deck)\n   * Domain specific data science questions (e.g. how would you apply data science to this private equity problem)\n   * Overall I felt comfortable with all aspects of the exam and felt that it was well within my wheelhouse\n* After completing the exam I sent a note to the recruiter. They scheduled a call with the \"senior recruiter\" for end of week\n* The call with senior recruiter was fairly standard and covered the nature of the team, responsibilities of the role, and my background. I thought the call went well and was under the impression that I'd be moving forward in the process  (though I've learned never to take what recruiters say at face value)\n* At the end of the call the senior recruiter asked if I had taken the Hackerrank exam yet. I was a bit surprised that they did not already know the answer to that question.\n* After exactly one week of radio silence since the initial call, I emailed the first recruiter to let them know that I had seen some progress in my other searches (true) and asked if my application was still in consideration. I did not receive a response to this email.\n* I waited one more week (two weeks since the initial call and about three weeks since I took the exam) and emailed the senior recruiter for a status update. I didn't receive a response to this email either but will edit this post if they ever do respond.\n\n# Conclusion\n\n* At this point I've concluded that I've been ghosted. I can only speculate as to why. I'm leaning towards them just being highly disorganized.\n* For future applicants I strongly, strongly advise not taking their HackerRank exam unless you don't mind having your time wasted. I'm willing to bet nobody at Carlyle even looked at my test responses.\n\n\\*\\*EDIT\\*\\*\n\nIt seems a lot of you think that ghosting is professionally acceptable. If you're investing your time, the bare minimum is a courtesy email to let you know you won't be moving forward in the process. That's actually table stakes.

The other half is somewhat equally split between finance, healthcare, and public sector work - each one individually is too small to plot with YOE, so I lumped everything together.\n* If YOE is unclear, I exclude tenures with no duration given (some time as an analyst).

Be it speaking up in meetings, pinging people in chat, voicing concerns with a work plan, these data scientists communicated on their own initiative and their ability to get things done and make an impact is recognized. \n2. They are capable of flushing out requirements and working on complicated tasks without managerial intervention. A good example of this could be manager says we need to build a model that satisfies xyz objectives and that there are additional business reqs we'll need to flush out. 2 or 3 data scientists go do all the work to get the data and flush out the requirments while making all the plans amongst themselves and basically just keeping the manager in the loop on what's happening. \n3. They focus on adding value over pursuing technical solutions. Often times the simpler modeling approach is good enough and it solves the problem in a quick fashion. \n\n\nThings noted about low preforming data scientists were:\n1. They were reactive in their communication\n2. They often times missed deadlines that they themselves set and never communicated that there were issues or that the deadline would be missed. \n3.

Years later, I always see people saying \"Python is a general-purpose language and R is for stats\", but I've never come across a single programming task that couldn't be completed with extraordinary efficiency in R. I've used R for everything from big data analysis (tens to hundreds of GBs of raw data), machine learning, data visualization, modeling, bioinformatics, building interactive applications, making professional reports, etc.\n\nIs there any truth to the dogmatic saying that \"Python is better than R for general purpose data science\"? It certainly doesn't appear that way on my end, but **I would love some specifics for how Python beats R in certain categories as motivation to learn the language.** For example, if R is a statistical language and machine learning is rooted in statistics, how could Python possibly be any better for that?",
        "comments": [
            "From my experience **Python excels** (vs R) when you move to writing production-grade code:\n\n- in my experience base Python (dicts, lists, iterating strings letter by letter) are much faster than base types in R\n- better OOP system than R's set of S3/S4/R6\n- function decorators\n- context managers\n- asynchronous i/o\n- type hinting and checking (R has a package typing that has something along these lines but nowhere to the level what Python has in terms of say Pydantic and mypy)\n- far more elaborate set of linting tools, e.g. black and flake8 trump anything in R\n- new versions and features coming far more quickly than R\n- data orchestration/automation tools that work out of the box, e.g. Airflow, Prefect (stupid easy learning curve, slap few decorators and you have your workflow)\n- version pinning, e.g. pyenv, poetry,  basically reproducible workflows\n- massive community support, unlike R, Python doesn't rely on one company (Posit) and bunch of academics to keep it alive. \n- FAANG companies have interest in developing not only Python packages but language itself, even more so with Global Interpreter Lock removal\n- web scraping, interfacing with various APIs even as common as AWS is a lot smoother in Python\n- PySpark >>> SparkR/sparklyr\n- PyPI >>> CRAN (CRAN submission is like a bad joke from stone age,  CRAN doesn't support Linux binaries(!!!)\n\n\n**R excels** in maybe lower number of other places, typically statistical tools, specific-domain support (e.g. bioinformatics/comp bio) and exploratory data analysis, but in things it is better it is just *so good*:\n\n- the number of stats packages is far beyond anything in Python\n- the number of bioinformatics packages is FAR beyond Python (especially on Bioconductor)\n- tidyverse (dplyr/tidyr especially) destroys every single thing I tried in Python, pandas here looks like a bad joke in comparison\n- delayed evaluation, especially in function arguments, results in some crazy things you can do wrt metaprogramming (e.g. package rlang is incredible, allows you to easily take the user provided code apart, supplement it, then just evaluate it in whatever environment you want... which I am sure breaks bunch of good coding practices but damn is it useful) \n- data.table syntax way cleaner than polars (again thanks to clever implementation of tidy evaluation and R-specific features)\n- Python's plotnine is good, but ggplot2 is still king - the number of additional gg* packages allows you to make some incredible visualizations that are very hard to do in Python\n- super-fluid integration with RMarkdown (although now Quarto is embracing Python so this point may be moot)\n- even though renv is a little buggy in my experience, RStudio/Posit Package Manager is fantastic\n- RStudio under very active development and IDE for exploratory work is in some specific ways better than anything for Python including VSCode (e.g. it recognizes data.frame/data.table/tibble contexts and column names and previews are available via tabbing)",
            "I wouldn\u2019t build a web server with R. But anything with statistics I would use R. Practically, I would use python for data acquisition. Web scraping, API interaction, automated SQL stuff. But then use R to create models and run analytics on that acquired data.",
            "I'll tell you why python is the better of the two languages for me: some of my coworkers know it.\n\nI'm one of 2 data scientists at a company of 50-ish people that consists largely of software developers. Most of my work is part of our product (as opposed to business intelligence). Even if I'm the one doing the \"data science\" of developing a model, putting it into production is a team effort. It's important that my coworkers can, for example, set up python virtual environments and modify the parts of code that manage credentials. Python is also supported natively by technologies such as AWS lambda that we use.",
            "So I took a similar path. It\u2019s less about what the base language can do, and more about the vast package support that python has that R does not yet have, or is awkward to work with for one reason or another. Depending on what field of expertise the responder has, the answers to this will probably differ. I\u2019ll focus on the stuff I am familiar with.\n\nThis may not be a common use case, but running your own pretrained llm or complex neural network for instance,requires you to either acquire the weights and then load them yourself into torch, or retrain the network from scratch. In python, most models are widely available and usable directly from huggingface. You can do the same in R, but working through a reticulate wrapper can get annoying and lead to weird unintuitive behavior\n\nBeyond that, working with aws and mlflow in R is possible, but both r versions are essentially wrappers around python libraries, which is fine but it leads to unintuitive access patterns.\n\nFor me- most of the time it\u2019s not that I can\u2019t do something in R that I do in python, it\u2019s just easier for me to do it in python. Particularly with aws frameworks that are built around Jupyter notebooks which can run R code but are more purpose-built for python. This may be my lack of experience talking, but I get way more headaches trying to spin up a cloud workload using R and terraform than when I use python and terraform.",
            "R wins for general purpose data science.\n\nPython wins for general purpose programming.\n\nThat\u2019s why Python has become the go to. It plays nicer when DSs, DEs, SWEs, MLEs, etc. have to work together."

        "content": "I was laid off from my company earlier this year after 1.8 years of successful work experience at this company. I was recognized three times over that period, given merit increases in bonuses, shares of stock as rewards. Constantly praised and recognized several times, and never disciplined in any way or even told that my performance was an issue. I was laid off and they admitted that it was not for performance reasons, I was a great employee, they would love to see me work for them again...\n\nSo I start reapplying, I'm very dedicated to working for this company, and the interviews that I get are much more challenging than they were when I started with the company. Previously, they asked me about my background, skills, experience, and had me interview with other people on the team. This time around, I had to do case studies that were extremely challenging. One of them I had 3 hours to go through an absurdly complex Excel assignment that involved three separate spreadsheets of data and building a data lookup tool using Excel. Like, creating a tableau report, just using data validation and dropdowns and stuff and conditional formatting I guess? Sounds stupid and I've never done something so crazy so yep I failed hard. Also had another interview based around SQL, which I know like the back of my hand. Aced the interview, and almost got an offer, but disqualified last round.\n\nThen I had another interview for BI engineer position, and they were \u201cdisappointed\u201d with me for not speaking to what SQL I\u2019d used. The manager was honestly a douche, I could tell just from his demeanor, and how he acted. Dude seemed like he was barely invested in the interview. It was supposed to be a meet and greet, NOT an interview, that\u2019s verbatim what I was told. Then I get told I should\u2019ve explained size of my SQL queries, how many rows, types of joins. Like uh, it\u2019s a meet and greet to learn more about the role, and YOU did not ask ME any of that either?\n\nIt\u2019s just so infuriating.... 3 years ago, we had 1-3 interviews for low to mid level jobs. Now its 3-8 interviews minimum plus 2+ case studies, for ANY JOB. Like, imagine working for a company and being praised for years, now because of \"economic conditions\" hundreds get laid off, and treated like children in interviews to rejoin the firm. This is just sad. ",

In this org, we are split into 3 parts: 1) Data Engineering, 2) Data Science, and 3) Business Analytics\n\nData Engineering builds the data pipelines, ETLs, and manages the data warehouse. Data Science works on very specific projects like recommender, search, and customer churn models.\n\nMeanwhile Business Analytics is like the business jobs that are also technical. Their job can be dashboarding, executive reporting, strategy insights, market analytics, etc. but they have to know a lot of SQL and some programming in order to extract the data and transform it into insights. They also need to know business context. It\u2019s like 50% coding and 50% making financial models and/or PowerPoint decks for execs.\n\nWhen we interview people, especially interns and younger candidates, nobody wants to do BA. Everyone wants to do DS. The ironic thing is the DS jobs are the fewest in quantity and they only hire the most qualified people (usually people with PhDs). All the DE people have backgrounds in CS and the BA people have backgrounds like people on this sub where they usually have a MS in DS or Analytics.\n\nIt just seems like the BA jobs are off putting to many candidates. As soon as I mention PowerPoint or excel, I can feel their souls die lol. The truth is it\u2019s part of the job, but there\u2019s more to it than that. I code a lot, I grab data from APIs, I go through developer docs, but yes, I also build decks and am good at it.

If they dislike probabilities, for example, if they have a \"just give me a simple yes or no\" attitude, or if they only want simple descriptives in flashy dashboards... it just feels like you end up not doing anything meaningful or deep with the data, and instead end up like serving their confirmation bias, dumbing down any potential analysis and inference, and accommodating to their non-analytical aesthetical needs.",
            "Because the pay is worse, the work is arguably not as respected, and DS provides more optionality for future roles.\n\nIMO, at a big company, the value that a great BA/DA adds over an average one can be greater than the incremental value of a great DS or MLE over an average one. But that's a pretty idiosyncratic take, and the way companies pay BAs/DAs makes it crystal clear that they don't agree with me.",
            "I think it's the thought that 'DS is the sexiest job from this decade'. DA looks like an assistant job compared to DS in those people's minds. It's not so sexy. You're not a ~scientist~. \n\nAnd people LOVE buzzwords. Excel? Nah. Deep learning? 'Omg I understand SO MUCH about DL, look at me'.\n\nYou can't change one's mind about that in an interview, but the best DAs would be killing to enter this position.

I would echo a lot of the reasons others have pointed out here: Better pay, more interesting work, less likelihood of making PowerPoints and managing Excel sheets, and so on.\n\nAnecdotally, too, I would say that part of the reason I\u2019ve stopped targeting BA roles is because the word \u201canalyst\u201d has been meaninglessly injected into every title, regardless of business function. Likewise, reviewing so-called \u201cbusiness analyst\u201d roles is usually a waste of my time, because they include responsibilities as mundane as customer service support, or as \u201ctechnical\u201d (being facetious here) as Excel. Honestly, most BA listings I\u2019ve seen *really* want a PM, but they choose to call it a BA for whatever reason.\n\nI\u2019ll still glance at the occasional BA role, but if it doesn\u2019t at least include some SQL, ideally some R/Python, and ideally ideally some hands-on statistical modeling work, I don\u2019t bother applying. Those latter \u201cideals\u201d are what push me to want DA and DS roles more often than not."

I have to keep track of customer and sales data for two large companies. Most of the data isn't even clean. There's about 5 platforms to keep track of for each. There's stupid meetings every day.

A stereotypical corporate bro. The most emotionless uncaring blunt workaholic person I've ever met. I can do nothing right in his eyes. I've never received a list of specific tasks to do. Sometimes I give him insights into some data and he ignores it. I don't care for a bunch of emotional shit but a little bit of empathy or something.

They\u2019re naive and young and while you can learn a lot of skills if you manage this correctly, they probably won\u2019t appreciate what you\u2019re achieving by doing so.\n\nSecond suggestion; while you\u2019re looking for a new job, take advantage of the heap of responsibility that has been balanced on your shoulders. Having some data engineering skills on your CV would serve you well. Tell your manager that you can\u2019t help them benefit from their data until their data is in an orderly condition. Support your statement with links and evidence, and most importantly, research and bring the solutions to them. Do not bring problems. (1) they won\u2019t know how to handle them (2) they will think you\u2019re making excuses. \n\nYou\u2019ll need some data pipelines and if you want them off your back for a little bit, invest some time in PowerBI.

I get paid $$374k (439k now due to stock appreciation) to do this at Google.\n\nThere\u2019s also product strategy focused DS that doesn\u2019t require SWE skills but can still pay very well and add enormous business value. Many people would call them \u201cjust DAs\u201d or \u201cSQL monkeys\u201d but the typical strong DA or product DS will have far more face time with the director, VP, and SVP product leadership layer of the company than the typical strong MLE. They can use that experience to jump into the DS director layer and be less limited by the absence of SWE skills. However you have to essentially operate as a management consultant or product manager that\u2019s unusually data driven. \n\nWhile I have good SWE skills \u2014 I\u2019ve deployed production ML models and been fully integrated into the software development teams of FANNG SWEs \u2014 and I have very strong stats skills \u2014 I\u2019m on the \u201ctechnical\u201d side of the DS divide at Google \u2014 I deeply respect the non-technical DA-type DS.\n\nI strongly recommend this blog, written by the chief decision scientist of google, to get a better perspective of the value different DS can bring: https://towardsdatascience.com/data-sciences-most-misunderstood-hero-2705da366f40. (I don\u2019t agree with everything she says, I think she unnecessarily discourages DS from having a strong point of view of product direction. Whenever I\u2019m on the analytics side of DS work, I\u2019m unapologetically outspoken about product direction, often attempting to exert as much leadership over PMs as they try to exert over me.

I apologize but I have to share. \n\nLast summer, completely against my will, I was told that I had to manage a high school intern who was in a program to prepare for college. The program was to get hands on experience at a company before they went to school so they could decide a career path with more information on what the day to day is like in the workplace.\n\nWhen I met this student, he informed me the program randomly placed the kids into jobs blindly. He had no idea what I did or what he was going to do. When I told him I am a data scientist, he was not happy and had no interest at all. He was hoping for a sales or marketing placement as that is more interesting to him.\n\nThe first week did not go well at all. He was very disinterested and vocal about it. So at the end of the week we did our required weekly progress report and I just begged him to give it a chance, because if he did poorly, we\u2019re both going to look bad. \n\nOver the course of the 4 months he was with me, we spent afternoons completing complex problems, learning various programs, and making key business decisions using data driven decision making. I taught him SQL, R, Python, and power bi-automate. The kid was a natural. As a junior in high school he picked everything up faster than any university intern or junior I have ever trained. \n\nWhen our time was up. He thanked me for the opportunity and admitted while it was far from a career path he would choose, he learned a lot of valuable lessons and appreciated the experience. I attended his \u201cgraduation ceremony\u201d from the program, we said our goodbyes, and parted ways. \n\n\nHere is where it gets just crazy. This morning, he sent me a long message on LinkedIn, wondering if I remembered him. And told me how inspiring our time was together. So much so that when he graduated this summer, he decided that he chose his college major (computer science & statistics) because of how gratifying the work we did was and how interested in data he became during our time. \n\nI\u2019ll admit, I bawled like a baby. I was so honored to receive that message, and it was so gratifying for myself to be able to get through to someone like that. \n\nTL:DR you never know who you can inspire, doing what we love with a passion.",

They are asking you to explain *which actual outcome becomes different when whatever you are building is added*, so that they can *help you sell your work to customers or downstream users,* and for you to indicate *what time and resources you need to make that happen*. Again, if you can not identify the action or decision which ends up different once your solution is in place, and describe how you optimize that outcome, you should be sceptical as to whether it is actually impactful.\n3. When you are asked to outline deliverables, they are *letting you explain to them in what way you prefer to deliver your value added*. That is giving you the power.

Spending your time making something perfect is often not worth the effort. \n\nSome people have horrible data literacy and you really have to spoon feed them your insights and recommendations and even then they still might not really understand. \n\nYou can have amazing technical and mathematical skills but if you suck at communication, no one (important) will know and that will hinder your career. \n\nWhat we want data science to be and what the business actually needs are often two different things. \n\nMost businesses will never hire as many data scientists/analysts as they truly need because we don\u2019t make money. My company easily has enough work/demand for our DS/analytics team to be 2x its size or more. But we don\u2019t build the product so budget for new positions almost always goes to software eng.

Been so for a whole year. This gave me a lot of business context, how a manager leads people under him, and how his manager looks at his performance and understood something about the hierarchical behavior of companies. \nThen, I left the job after a year, now it's the pandemic, I spent it leqrning Excel and basic statistics, all on YouTube.\n\nMoving forward to when I was 20, I had no idea a data analyst is even a title, and got a job as an accountant at a small workshop, with college going on, and I was studying business administration and statistics.\nThe job was never an accountant or have anything to do with accounting, my manager at the time was a very smart guy, working with pen and paper as his ledger, then I introduced Excel, he was all in for it, I started creating tables for our sales and inventory and customers and places we work in.\n\nHe started asking questions, you said last month we made 40K, how come we make 45 this month? I started digging into our data unknowingly doing analysis.\n\nHis brother was a regular visitor, I learned that he is the head of data at a big startup in our country, saw what I did, kept giving me tasks and I answer with Excel.\n\nThen, he gave me a course that I highly recommend about Excel: power tools in Excel, you can find sources on YouTube for it a lot (power query, power pivot and data modeling). I started applying DAX, and here comes my first book [Dax Guide](https://www.google.com.eg/books/edition/_/dtr8oQEACAAJ?hl=en&sa=X&ved=2ahUKEwiQo4eZ8OKEAxUXgP0HHXfgDTIQ7_IDKAB6BAgPEAM).\n\nThen I started my LinkedIn journey, showing Excel and powerBI dashboards and applying to jobs, in data analysis, really that's all you need, business context, some technical tools to help you dig into the data and answer questions.\n\nThen, I started reading about data science, how statistics is important and how much I liked it in college, here goes the second book, [Naked Statistics](https://www.amazon.com/Naked-Statistics-Stripping-Dread-Data-ebook/dp/B007Q6XLF2).\nHere I learned to think with stats a bit.\n\nThen, I found that I lack implementation to a lot of concepts to statistics, people recommended python for me, here there were two sources for me to learn from, YouTube courses got me up and running into how to write simple code in python and understand the syntax.\n\nLater, DataCamp had tracks, I finished the Data Analyst with python and another one data analyst with SQL. This helped me BIG time in knowing where to go next. \n\nNote: I was doing all of that while working and being in college.\n\nThe DataCamp course had great courses about statistics and probability and simulation. While also practicing SQL, I got really good with it.\n\nNow, got a job as a junior sales ops analyst (my role now). I got lucky, working on real problems and practicing what I learn.\n\nThen started moving back to books, but I lacked problem solving mindset, read these books: [Stop Guessing](https://www.amazon.com/Stop-Guessing-Behaviors-Problem-Solvers/dp/162656986X) and[Lean Analytics](https://leananalyticsbook.com/).\n\nThis helped me big time understand how my work affects the company. \n\nNow it's time to show your work to stakeholders, I read this book: [Storytelling with data](https://leananalyticsbook.com/).\n\nIt's time to go back to the details of my job, It was all querying on metabase, an open source BI tool.\n\nI was responsible for giving agents retailers to visit, so, Every morning, we are supposed to apply filters on our data (last order date, last visit date and some other features ) and tell the agent, visit 20 of those retailers and go home. I was doing all of that in an automated fashion with power query, creating automated pipelines was my passion in Excel. All I had to do was give it an updated file from our database, refresh the pipeline, take the new file, dump it into our system.\n\nThey do visit 20 retailers, but the problem reached the tech team, the data was too much to handle, requiring us to give a smaller set of retailers for the agents, specifically 40 retailers.\n\nBut how do we guarantee they are close to each other? Here come my first interaction with adata scientist.\n\nI did all what I did in Excel but in python using pandas and then reached the point where I don't know how to give clusters.\n\nHe took my jupyter notebook, gave it to us back with the solution to our problem, with something I was not familiar with at the time, Kmeans constrained.\nWhich took only longitude, latitude gave each agent his route of 40 retailers.\n\nI started taking notes from his improvements to my code and asked him, what did you do?\n\nHe told my my code was fine, but you used a lot of custom functions on operations that can be vectorized, I asked for a book recommendation about vectorized operations in pandas here, the guys recommended this [Data Wrangling in python book](https://www.amazon.com/Data-Wrangling-Python-Tools-Easier/dp/1491948817).\n\nAfter that book, I was obsessed with data automation in python using pandas and numpy only.\n\nI got also obsessed with vectorizing any operation in our code base, read something pandas specific now: [Effective Pandas](https://www.amazon.com/Effective-Pandas-Patterns-Manipulation-Treading/dp/B09MYXXSFM).\n\nThen, it was the part where he interacted with our system API.\n\nSince all our company data scientists and swes have access to snowflake and live databases, we, analysts, had access to only metabase.\n\nI saw this as an opportunity to get known!\n\nI wrote two functions used by our entire company, ret_metabase and interact_with_google_sheets\nThe first one connects to the API endpoint and then takes your credintials and the makes a session ID and gets your card ID string response in json and I convert it to a dataframe. The second requires an Api key, thenenables tge user to do anything with a google sheet, remove data set with a dataframe get data asa dataframe append on data filter views really anything in one function.\nHow did I learn to do all of that? A course on youtube , just type API development in python amd a book about data structures, [Grokking Algorithms](https://www.amazon.com/Effective-Pandas-Patterns-Manipulation-Treading/dp/B09MYXXSFM). This helped big time in optimizing my code performance and writing cleaner code.\n\nI got known and these functions are in the companies library now and people use it all the time. And I even left funny comments in the documentation and Everything.\n\nThe kmeans thing got me really interested in machine learning and here's the first book you guys recommended: [ISLR](https://www.statlearning.com/).\n\nIt was really hard for me at first because I had not been introduced properly to those three topics:\n1- linear algebra\n2- calculus\n3- probability and statistics\nI took [Jon Krohn's live lessions](https://github.com/jonkrohn/ML-foundations) it's free on YouTube.\n\nBut those three were later taken (started linear algebra in November 23).\n\nSo I struggled back then and here, another book was suggested: Hands-on ML.\n\nI finished it and was really fucking hyped to apply the stuff I learned directly into my job, even without my manager permissions.\n\nBut that was not enough, I did not know what I should do to impact our compqny, what is data science?\n\nI read this book: [Data science with business, what you need to know about DS](https://www.amazon.com/Data-Science-Business-Data-Analytic-Thinking/dp/1449361323)\n\nFirst thing I dod after understanding what kmeans is, improved our routes clustering function by standerdizing the scales of the long, lat, giving it another column ( retailer rank) that rankstarts at the maximum value the longitude and decays linearly from 31 to 30 (longitude here is from 30 to 31), I used linspace and select in numpy here to give retailers ranks. This rank was business objective (give 31 toretailers with high conversion and then 30.9 to retailers with monotonically decreasing nmv to make them order back and so on...) Any other retailer takes a zero in his face. This helped in giving optimized distance to retailers we really need to visit.\n\nThis gave us a big boost in agents strike rate and overall performance.\n\nSecond, I applied xgboost, predicting who will place an order today if visited. Gave them the biggest rank.\n\nTesting this was a must, so I learned about A/B testing, and some other great bootstrapping ideas here [Practical Statistics](https://www.oreilly.com/library/view/practical-statistics-for/9781491952955/) Book.\n\nThis pushed our strike rate from 40 to 73%.\n\nThen, I really now see that I lack probability knowledge and maths knowledge to be a data scientist, so I read [Essential maths for DS](https://www.amazon.eg/-/en/Essential-Math-Data-Science-Fundamental/dp/1098102932).\n\nSince my job was about sales operations, it was a necessary thing to automate discovering new sales areas and opportunity, previously, we used to draw polygons in areas we want to open, and then the agents are set there to wander and find retailers on their own.\n\nI got an idea, how about I get all streets know in this area and make blocks in the intersections and then convert the coords to google maps link and give 50 daily sequential links to agents to discover areas in a more naturally sequential way? I used omnix API to get streets data and geopandas to make all other operations, I learned how to work with geopandas from their docs, really straightforward.\n\nThis project was big, applied everything I know about pandas and data structures and business knowledge to do it, and it's up and running now.\n\nI got praised for it and the head of data was impressed with the result and decided to give me access to snowflake directly to limit requests on metabase as the data was big and then I scaled the project to all regions we operate in.\n\nThen it was time to speak with the senior ds lead.\n\nI showed him all I wrote here, he recommended I get a strong foundation in linear algebra and calculus and probability.\n\nI got it, and now working on probability and statistics.\n\nI then told him I am really into causal inference (rwcommended by someone in my previous post here) and regression analysis.\n\nHe said that's exactly what they need from the junior they want to hire, \"anyone can fit and predict nowdays\" he said, \"we need someone who can make an impact in all the stuff we don't have time for and teach him more cloud tools and maybe he gives us new ideas or show us new tools\" he elaborated.\n\nRight now I am studying probability and statistics and then will study [Causal Inference](https://www.oreilly.com/library/view/causal-inference-in/9781098140243/).\n\n\nI guess that's all, the most important thing is that you keep studying and never giving up, please, focus more on business context as it's overlooked.\n\nI hope this was useful to you guys.",

While these advancements can undoubtedly enhance our work, it's important to remember that data science isn't about using the most advanced or expensive tools; it's about extracting valuable insights from data to drive informed decision-making.\n\nData Collection and Categorization\n\nBefore diving into advanced machine learning algorithms or statistical models, we need to start with the basics: collecting and organizing data. Fortunately, both Python and R offer a wealth of libraries that make it easy to collect data from a variety of sources, including web scraping, APIs, and reading from files. Key libraries in Python include [requests](https://requests.readthedocs.io/en/latest/), [BeautifulSoup](https://beautiful-soup-4.readthedocs.io/en/latest/), and [pandas](https://pandas.pydata.org/), while R has [httr](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/httr/index.html), [rvest](https://rvest.tidyverse.org/), and [dplyr](https://dplyr.tidyverse.org/).\n\nThese libraries not only make it easy to collect data but also to clean and structure it for analysis. With just a few lines of code, you can filter, sort, and transform data into a format that's ready for exploration and modeling.\n\nData Analysis and Visualization\n\nOnce your data is collected and organized, the next step is to analyze and visualize it. Both Python and R excel in this area, providing a wide range of libraries and packages for exploratory data analysis and visualization.\n\nPython's pandas, [NumPy](https://numpy.org/), and [SciPy](https://scipy.org/) libraries offer powerful functionality for data manipulation, while [matplotlib](https://matplotlib.org/), [seaborn](https://seaborn.pydata.org/), and [plotly](https://plotly.com/) provide versatile tools for creating visualizations. Similarly, in R, you can use dplyr, [tidyverse](https://www.tidyverse.org/), and [data.table](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/data.table/vignettes/datatable-intro.html) for data manipulation, and [ggplot2](https://ggplot2.tidyverse.org/), [lattice](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/lattice/index.html), and [shiny](https://shiny.rstudio.com/) for visualization. These packages enable you to create insightful visualizations and perform statistical analyses without relying on expensive or proprietary software.\n\nModeling and Prediction\n\nFinally, when it comes to building models and making predictions, Python and R have a plethora of options available. Libraries like [scikit-learn](https://scikit-learn.org), [statsmodels](https://www.statsmodels.org/stable/index.html), and [TensorFlow](https://www.tensorflow.org/)in Python, or [caret](https://topepo.github.io/caret/), [randomForest](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/randomForest/randomForest.pdf), and [xgboost](https://xgboost.readthedocs.io/en/stable/)in R, provide powerful machine learning algorithms and statistical models that can be applied to a wide range of problems. What's more, these libraries are open-source and have extensive documentation and community support, making it easy to learn and apply new techniques without needing specialized training or expensive software licenses.\n\nSimplicity is key, embrace it and you'll learn a lot faster than trying to glean insights from some poorly trained AI model.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nps.

And have been told numerous times how important the success of this project is for my company\u2019s financial future and if the project isn\u2019t successful we would lose this major client - and there is a strict deadline for 1 months time to complete this major project, which includes answering over 20 giant questions about the data, with many deliverables (it doesn\u2019t help the quality of data is absolutely garbage). \n\nIt\u2019s only been 3 days and I feel so out of my depth.

Or maybe it should and I\u2019m going crazy. \n\nMy manager is great but has little time to support me. \n\nNot sure what to do or feel, but terrified and burnt out already by the thought of failing this project, losing the company tons of money and maybe getting fired as I\u2019m on probation for the first 6 months of my job. \n\nOr am I a pussy and this is just normal for a junior?",

If you stick it out, there may be good things to come.  \n\nMy personal advice: lower the bar for the data science on this one and up the bar for the presentation and the clarify.  Seems like they don't need a ML model.  They want a really nice report or dashboard with a clear message.  Simply looking at costs and revenues and trends up/down may be just what they want and you can deliver it with an attractive Quarto notebook or Power BI dashboard.",

Start quietly applying for something else (preferrably not an early stage startup)  and work on the project the best you can.

            "It's not normal to put so much pressure on a new hire and I'm sorry they put you into this position. I'd say this is a huge red flag and think you should start applying elsewhere immediately. The fate of the company does not rest on your shoulders, especially as a new hire. You are not the owner; this is not \"your\" company. If your bosses are looking for a scapegoat don't let them push the blame on you. It's not your responsibility if the client leaves and it's not your responsibility if the company has put all their eggs in one basket with this client. They know you want to do a good job and don't know any better and they are taking advantage of that. There are other jobs that are a better fit for you. Jobs are like relationships - there's plenty of fish in the sea, you don't marry the first person who shows interest, and you don't stay with an abuser.\n\nAs far as the project, think of it as something that will look great on your resume and your goal is to complete it to the best of your ability. Make a schedule/calendar of every work day you have from now until it's due. Write down the big steps you need to do to complete the project and then break down those big steps into smaller steps. Email it to your supervisor. Start working on Step 1a, get it done, then work on Step 1b, etc. Keep track of each step you complete and add that experience to your resume as you apply for new jobs. Any problems or delays, email your supervisor so you have proof that they knew what you were doing and how things were going. If you stumble, ask for help in an email.",

Might be best to have a hard conversation with the CTO saying that the data isnt in a place for easy wins, and maybe you can answer a few questions confidently by the deadline. \n\nIts definitely worth having one or two awkward discussions, rather than burning yourself out over the next month for an impossible feat. \n\nMaybe go into the meeting with a realistic timeline, and milestones so they can get more grounded.....\n\nBest of luck."

But they tend to occupy a particular niche, and their claims to radically transform the business world are gone. They aren't the 'sexiest job of the 21 century\". People have been trying to do this whole \"Business, but with Models!\" thing for *years*. But it never really caught on. Why?\n\nDS is just hype, and the hype cycle for DS will implode and not recover. Or it will recover to the same level that these other techniques did.\n\nData Science isn't better than any of those other disciplines. Here is my response to some objections:\n\n* **Maybe they weren't adding real business value?** Crack open the average Operations Research / Management Science textbook and I guarantee you you'll find problems which are more business-focused than anything you'll find on Towards Data Science or a DS textbook. They developed remarkable models to deal with inventory problems, demand estimation, resource planning, scheduling problems, forecasting and insights gathering - and most of their models were even prescriptive and automated using Optimization solvers.\n* **But they weren't putting their models in production right?** Yes, but the concept of doing a regression on a huge business data base, or even using a decision tree, is decades old now. It used to be called \"Knowledge Discovery in Databases\" and later \"Data Mining\". The ISLR of data mining, Witten's *Data Mining*, was first published in 2003. That's 20 years ago. They were using Java to do everything we do today, and at a reasonable scale (especially considering that with many of these problems, an extra GB of data doesn't get you much).\n* **But they weren't doing predictive modelling.** TBH predictive modelling is one of the least impressive sub-branches of modelling, I have no idea why it's so hyped. Much more interesting and relevant models - optimization modelling, risk analysis, forecasting, clustering - have all fallen out of popularity. Why do you think predictive modelling is the secret bullet? Besides, they did have some predictive modelling - 'data mining' used to include it as a part of the study, together with other 'modern' techniques like anomaly detection, association rules/market basket analysis.\n* **But what about \\[insert specific application here\\]**. Most of the things that people pitch as being 'things we can now do with data science' are decades old. For example, customer segmentation models using 'data science' to help you better understand customers... You can find marketing analytics textbooks from the late 90s that show you exactly how to do that. And they'll include a hell of a lot more domain knowledge than most data science articles today, which seem to think that the domain knowledge just needs an introductory paragraph to grok and then we get to the Python.\n* **Maybe it just takes time?** Wayne Winston's *Operations Research* was published in 1987 and included material that could help you basically automate a significant amount of your business decision making with a PC. That was 36 years ago.\n* **But what about big data?** The law of large numbers and the central limit theorem still apply. At a certain point, the extra gigabyte of data isn't really helping, and neither is the extra column in the database.\n* **Data Science is much more complex and advanced, true data science requires a PhD**. An actual graduate level course in Operations Research requires you to integrate advanced linear algebra, computational algorithms and PhD level statistics to develop automated solutions that scale. People with these skills have been building enormous models for the airline industry for a few decades now, but were barely recognized for it. DS isn't that much more complex, so what justifies the large salaries and hype when com. sci + math + stats at scale has been around for a while now?\n\nThe marginal improvement in the performance of a subset of statistical techniques (predictive modelling, forecasting) doesn't justify the sudden exuberance about DS and 'data'.\n\nAs best I can tell, here is what is truly new in 'data science':\n\n* ML means we can turn unstructured data like videos and images and text into structured data: e.g. easily estimating the amount of damage by a flood for an insurer using satellite images.\n* People in Silicon Valley can have human-out-the-loop decision making, which they need for their apps and recommenders. This use case is truly new and didn't exist in the 90s.\n\nI think that this kind of 'operational data science' makes sense: using truly new types of data from video to images, and having computers which we can trust to label the data and apply further logic to it. That's new.\n\nBut the kind of data science where you think that you submitting a report or visualisation to your boss and then he'll take it into consideration when he makes decisions - that's been around for ages. It's never become the kind of revolutionary, widespread force in business that DS keeps promising it will be. In ten years, \"data scientist\" will be like Operations Researcher - a very niche and special thing off in the corner somewhere which most people don't know about outside of a particular industry.\n\nThe only people who managed to really turn maths into money were the Actuarial Scientists and the Quants (Financial Engineers).\n\nMy take now is basically this:\n\n* If you work in the actual niche where data science has something new to offer - processing unstructured data for use in live apps like Tinder - then yes, continue. That's great. That's the equivalent of doing Operations Research and going into logistics.\n* If you are trying to apply those same techniques to general business decision making, then you are going to end up like a \"Management Scientist\" or, for that matter, a \"BI Analyst\" in a few years - they were once the cutting edge just like DS is now. They amounted to very little. There's really no difference. Predictive modelling is not so much more amazing than optimization or association rules, which nobody talks about much anymore.\n* If you just want to make a lot of money doing maths - go for Actuarial Science or Financial Engineering/Quants. Those guys figured it out and then created a walled garden of credentials to protect their salaries. Just join them. (Although I hear Act Sci is more about regulations in practise than maths, but still).\n\ntl;dr - DS is just the latest in a long string of equally 'revolutionary' and impressive attempts at introducing scientific decision making into business. It will become as marginalised as all of them in the future, outside of the Silicon Valley niche. Your boss, your company and your industry will never adopt a true data-driven culture - they've had almost 40 years to do it by now and they're still suspicious of regression beyond the 'line of best fit'. It's not happening fam.",

            "To me, it's better to separate out two distinct things: \n\n***Data science as a normal job*** is just a rebranding of all those existing quantitative methods that you mentioned.  If you look at DS jobs at banks or insurance companies or logistics firms or CPG, they largely consist of the same data and modeling tasks that have always been done, just with a shiny coat of paint to attract the young un's, maybe with Python and R instead of Matlab or SAS.  They used to be called \"Statisticians\" or \"Quantitative Researchers\" or whatever.  I think this is more or less fine.     \n\n***Data science as a $300k/year job*** is a ZIRP phenomenon.  Sometimes I get the impression that prospective candidates and even gainfully employed data scientists are experiencing this sense of loss, of feeling like they missed out on this gold rush of the last 10 years, when it seemed like growth-crazed tech companies were handing out lucrative offers to anyone with a Kaggle profile and everyone else was forced to up their game to compete.  Not entirely sure it was ever that frothy, but admittedly, the barrier to entry \\*was\\* lower and the early movers did enjoy some good times.  Who cares if your newly-formed data science team never did anything worth a damn?  Those paychecks kept clearing anyway.\n\nThis era is done.  Of course, you can still get a high-paying job.  But it'll be more like becoming a surgeon: specialized training and experience that is only valuable at a small handful of companies.  But for everyone else, \"data science as a normal job\" will still be there, just like GPs are still around and necessary.",
            "This is a very confusing post.  You say Data Science is a fad, but I think you mean the term 'Data Science' is a fad because like you pointed out, there have been other terms used in different times to describe using data, math, and programming to optimize business solutions.  So if anything, there is a long history of using these tools to make smarter decisions and so the work of a data scientist is anything but a fad.\n\nFrom other comments you left, you mentioned that you are in your 20's and that you seem to be pretty unhappy with your current situation.  You say that a company has had 40 years to become data focused, but they haven't?  John Deere has been around for over a century and now have more software engineers than mechanical engineers.  They took a mechanical product that was driven by a person to a mechanical product that is driven by autonomously due to the use of large amounts of data.\n\nI'm curious, what is your background?",

I am trying to reply as fast as I can to the DMs. But since I found a few FAQs,  I will list them out here.\n\n1. I got my job in India and not in USA/Europe.\n2. I have not done any masters.\n3. There are lots of moving parts to getting a job. Since I do not know what you are doing wrong or right, I can't provide any new tips/tricks that you probably haven't seen reels/videos/articles of.\n4. Scoring an interview has a different skillset from cracking the interview. The former is mostly non-technical, the latter being extremely technical.\n5. If you have anything specific area I can assist with, I am more than happy to help if I can.\n6. Again, I must request you to not ask me for guidance without being specific - I do not know what you are doing wrong or right, so me repeating the same advice won't work. For e.g. a specific question might be  - \"*Is DSA necessary to learn*?\" Then no, I have neither studied DSA nor have been asked in any of my 30+ interviews I have given. However, it's not a thumb rule that you might not be asked.\n\nPlease understand that I am not being rude here, but rather trying to not repeat the same vanilla tips/tricks/guidance that you probably have not come across already.",

        "score": 306,
        "comment counts": 149,
        "content": "The bulk of this subreddit is filled with people trying to break into data science, completing certifications and getting MS degrees from diploma mills but with no real guidance. Oftentimes the advice I see here is from people without DS jobs trying to help other people without DS jobs on projects etc. It's more or less blind leading the blind.\n\nHere's an insider perspective from me. I'm a hiring manager at an F50 financial services company you've probably heard of, I've been working for \\~4 years and I'll share how entry-level roles actually get hired into.\n\nThere's a few different pathways. I've listed them in order of where the bulk of our candidate pool and current hires comes from\n\n1. We pick MS students from very specific programs that we trust. These programs have been around for a while, we have a relationship with the school and have a good idea of the curriculum. Georgia Tech, Columbia, UVa, UC Berkeley, UW Seattle, NCSU are some universities we hire from. We don't come back every year to hire, just the years that we need positions filled. Sometimes you'll look around at teams here and 40% of them went to the same program. They're stellar hires. The programs that we hire from are incredibly competitive to get into, are not diploma mills, and most importantly, their programs have been around longer than the DS hype. How does the hiring process work? We just reach out to the career counselor at the school, they put out an interest list for students who want to work for us, we flip through the resumes and pick the students we like to interview. It's very streamlined both for us as an employer and for the student. Although I didn't come from this path (I was a referred by a friend during the hiring boom and just have a PhD), I'm actively involved in the hiring efforts.\n2. We host hackathons every year for students to participate in. The winners of these hackathons typically get brought back to interview for internship positions, and if they perform well we pick them up as full time hires.\n3. Generic career fairs at universities. If you go a to a university, you've probably seen career fairs with companies that come to recruit.\n4. Referrals from our current employees. Typically they refer a candidate to us, we interview them, and if we like them, we'll punt them over to the recruiter to get the process started for hiring them. Typically the hiring manager has seen the resume before the recruiter has because the resume came straight to their inbox from one of their colleagues\n5. Internal mobility of someone who shows promise but just needs an opportunity. We've already worked with them in some capacity, know them to be bright, and are willing to give them a shot even if they don't have the skills.\n6. Far and away the worst and hardest way to get a job, our recruiter sends us their resume after screening candidates who applied online through the job portal. Our recruiters know more or less what to look for (I'm thankful ours are not trash)\n\nThis is true not just for our company but a lot of large companies broadly. I know Home Depot, Microsoft and few other large retail companies some of my network works at hire candidates this way.\n\nIs it fair to the general population? No. But as employees at a company we have limited resources to put into finding quality candidates and we typically use pathways that we know work, and work well in generating high quality hires.\n\nEDIT: Some actionable advice for those who are feeling disheartened. I'll add just a couple of points here:\n\n1. If you already have your MS in this field or a related one and are looking for a job, reach out to your network. Go to the career fairs at your university and see if you can get some data-adjacent job in finance, marketing, operations or sales where you might be working with data scientists. Then you can try to transition internally into the roles that might be interesting to you.\n2. There are also non-profit data organizations like Data Kind and others. They have working data scientists already volunteering time there, you can get involved, get some real world experience with non-profit data sets and leverage that to set yourself apart. It's a fantastic way to get some experience AND build your professional network.\n3. Work on an open-source library and making it better. You'll learn some best practices. If you make it through the online hiring screen, this will really set you apart from other candidates\n4. If you are pre MS and just figuring out where you want to go, research the program's career outcomes before picking a school. No school can guarantee you a job, but many have strong alumni and industry networks that make finding a job way easier. Do not go just because it looks like it's easy to get into. If it's easy to get into, it means that they're a new program who came in with the hype train\n\nEDIT 2: I think some people are getting the wrong idea about \"prestige\" where the companies I'm aware of only hire from Ivies or public universities that are as strong as Ivies. That's not always the case - some schools have deliberately cultivated relationships with employers to generate a talent pipeline for their students. They're not always a top 10 school, but programs with very strong industry connections.\n\nFor example, Penn State is an example of a school with very strong industry ties to companies in NJ, PA and NY for engineering students. These students can go to job fairs or sign up for company interest lists for their degree program at their schools, talk directly to working alumni and recruiters and get their resume in front of a hiring manager that way. It's about the relationship that the university has cultivated to the local industries that hire and their ability to generate candidates that can feed that talent pipeline.",

            "This is an interesting post for new grads with no experience. Let me offer an alternative solution for those that didn't go to elite schools.\n\nExperience.\n\nWhile I'm not a hiring manager at an F50 I am a data scientist at an F50 that's been involved in the hiring process for multiple other data scientists, including Junior positions. Before this I worked at another multi-billion dollar insurance company that hired tons of data scientists.\n\nIn my personal opinion, if you're looking to get a data scientist position and you didn't go to some elite school the single best decision you could make would be to get experience in data as either a data analyst, junior database administrator, or data engineer.  \n\nYes, I know your degree says data science.  That doesn't mean you're ready for a data scientist position. Put in a few years as a data analyst and it will be far easier for you to get a data scientist position either at your current company or new company.\n\nFor our Junior data scientist positions we hired exactly one person who had no experience, but it just finished grad school. That person did come from a top tier School. All of the other Juniors that we hired had some level of experience (beyond just an internship) as data analysts before.",
            "Excellent post to address the endless stream of posts from people trying to break into data science. It\u2019s important to remember that part of what makes a top tier program is that they are integrated into a network of business, government, and academic institutions. These programs are recruited from for internships, have researchers collaborating with name recognized companies and government agencies. Part of the reason to get a higher level degree is to insert yourself into one of these environments and use it as a career spring board. A degree from an underdeveloped program may yield a degree which missed out on this keystone.",
            "What are the specific programs?",
            "As a Northwestern Alumni, current Data Scientist, and a former F150 railroad employee, this is very much on par with what I've seen in the industry. I think the biggest advise I'd give people looking to get into the industry is\n\n 1) Find a university with a reputation for it's degree program. I personally took over a decade to choose a master's program that fit me. While I know this is abnormally a long time to choose for someone, I didn't want just any degree that was a piece of paper. I wanted a program that was challenging, I could network with persons in the industry for which my degree was in, and that university has a strong, known presence.. The railroad at the time was very much recruiting from NW and other top schools, in various fields.\n\n2) Don't just do the bare minimum in your program. Network, and get to know your cohorts. You never know when an opportunity will present itself within your network. Many of my cohorts work FAANGs. It'll also allow you to keep a good understanding of how the industry is heading. It's also easier to get a job interview at a company with an internal reference than it is cold through a recruiter.\n\n3) Tackle real-world business problems. The hack-a-thons are a great way to hone your skills in a real-world problem. Kaggle also has great competitions where you can hone your skills. While I was working in Masters program, I reached out to local businesses in need of Data Science services and offered to use them as a focus for our research projects within the classes. I then gave them the results of our research, and final programs, models. Etc...\n\nIt's a grind. Keep at it."

Just like most people think they have cancer when they google long enough just to end up being told it's something entirely different and harmless by a physician...\n* **Responsibility:** Someone needs to be responsible for the results. That someone also has to be a person that understands what's behind the graph. Just like being able to code in Java helps you with Python in Databricks, because you have an easier time understanding error messages. An MBA manager can easily type in some prompts but when something goes wrong, 'I didn't know' is no excuse. You often can't revert bad business decisions. Similar situations for a physician.

            "It's tough because data science / analytics was the go-to for STEM graduates with no real job prospects.

        "content": "Hello,\n\nI'm a so-called data scientist with 4 YoE and an academic background in maths (pretty much nothing in software engineering).\n\nMy first job out of college was in a small \"data team\" (I was the only DS, there were 2 others guys, mostly seniors and sort of a mix of Data Engineer/Devops/Software Engineer). Our team mission was to bring value to the company using data.\n\nJob was pretty chill, tbh I haven't been doing much over the 4 years. Mostly failed POC on jupyter and a lot of non-DS-related stuff (like dashboarding type of stuff).\n\nHowever, there was one initiative I took that resulted in something that was deemed valuable enough to be pushed into production. It was a mix of NLP/timeseries project which actually gave some very interesting results, although if I'm being honest, it is definitely not worth the 4 years of salary they paid me.\n\nAs I was asked to industrialize the solution, I had some help from my other 2 senior colleagues who introduced me to linux, git, docker/kubernetes, flask, airflow, and some good coding practices such as linting, testing, hinting, logging, classes and decorators on Python.\n\nThe thing is, they never reviewed my work nor made sure I was following all the recommended guidelines, and as I was overwhelmed by all those new concepts, I ended up just not following them, or not correctly at least.\n\nLike sure, I'll use git to track my code. Guess what, I never work with branching and just commited everything on the same master branch.\n\nClasses and decorators ? No that's too complex and abstract, let's just do it plain and simple.\n\nTesting and hinting ? Maybe later.\n\nCouple of times I have tried to motivate myself to learn all of this properly on my own, but although I have learned some stuff this and there, I have never reached that stage where I feel comfortable using all this, and always felt unmotivated afterwards by how vast those subjects are and how little I knew.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n3 months ago, my manager who used to be a technical guy but has been doing managing for quite some time now, and who for some reason always thought I was someone brilliant and creative out of the bunch (he led 3 other teams with a total of \\~20 people) was hired by a mid-size company to become their head of data. He offered me a position here as a senior data scientist which I took. He then hired a couple of other data scientists (they introduced themselves as MLE rather than DS) with about 2 YoE.\n\nThose guys are so good they are making me feel like a fraud. They are using git as if they invented the tool. The way they structured their code, using mostly classes and decorators everywhere just baffles me. They seem to have no trouble with devops concept (like CI/CD), API management, networks etc ... while I'm here struggling with the proxy of my VM just to reach the internet.\n\nI've recently discovered the joy of reviewing PR on github and boy it is exhausting to follow what they do. I basically have to google everything as they are using stuff I didn't even knew existed. It probably took me 10 hours to review a bunch of code they wrote in probably one hour.\n\nI am sure by now they see me as a fraud, and they seem to be both the kind of judging type (3 weeks in and they already had some heated arguments on software engineering). I think so far I was protected by my \"senior\" title and the fact that I have known our manager for quite some time now, but I'm expecting that this masquerade will not hold for long.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nI'm lost, IDK what to do. Is there a way for me to catch up everything in a short amount of time ? I understand that a regular data scientist with \"expertise\" in ML is no longer bankable and people now are turning towards \"full-stack\" MLE with a software engineering background, who are able to manage the entire pipeline and  produce professional code that is robust, readable and maintanable.",

            "If they're ML Engineers by background, they will for sure be better at the engineering side of things than someone who was primarily a data scientist. I don't think you should worry about this too much - it's normal. Do you have the skills/understanding to know what to do to get value from the data, even if you aren't so up to speed on engineering best practices? If so, you'll be fine - you can demonstrate your value by proposing good experiments or solutions, even if your code isn't perfect (though of course, do still try to get up to speed on the engineering so you can contribute to the team more effectively! The more PRs you review from them, the faster you'll get and the more you'll incorporate what you learn into your code, too).",
            "So here's a few things I can grok just from reading your description.  FWIW, I'm a \"manager\" of software engineering and data science teams.  \n\n\n1) Your manager brought you on probably because you write code quickly and you're reliable.  When you say you'll do something it gets done and it mostly works.  You probably also don't lie and bullshit about parts of the system you disagree with on principal and are mostly focused on delivering business value.  This is a MASSIVE attribute to have and managers see it as invaluable.  You manager's manager doesn't give a fuck if the software your manager's team wrote is well documented, elegant, or optimized.  All they care about is if it's working, done, and in the clients hands.  \n\n\n2) Your manager probably feels like they can trust you.  When something is REALLY bad and you say so they know it's actually probably a legit business concern and not just some Poindexter pontificating on the \"what if were as big as Google and this problem took down the whole company\" disaster scenario.  You probably weren't brought on to be \"the guy\" who rips out code and frameworks.  You were brought on to be the adult in the room.  \n\n\n3) A pattern I notice a lot with your type is that you people define your worth based almost only on your ability to know more than other people.  Then, you compare yourself with other people who know more than you and beat the living shit out of yourself.  However, you never really get to the point of asking yourself \"what about the 90% of people who are actually bad at their jobs, just hanging around hoping they won't get fired, and will never get poached by an old boss?\"  There's a lot of those people in industry so chip-up.  Use this as an opportunity to learn from your teammates and be a positive force where you can on the team.  Before long you'll be up to speed.  \n\n3)  I probably shouldn't tell this one... BUT....  Your manager is going to feel like a real dipshit if he goes to his boss and says \"uhhh, remember that guy I said was great and that we hired???  Well he sucks and now I need to justify cutting him\".  Not that it isn't possible if there's a layoff, but he looks like a doofus with bad judgement if he has to fire the dude he just subverted the recruiting process to bring on the team.  \n\n\nMore unsolicited advice:  try to get into a regular (daily) practice of 10 minutes of mindfullness meditation.  Sam Harris's intro course on his Waking Up app is a good start.  You'll learn to catch yourself in negative thought patterns and dismiss them from your mind.  Remember, you are more than your last thought.",
            "I'll preface this by saying that you seem to me to have strong fundamentals. However, from what you've described, there _is_ a real problem with the way you've been working, namely that you didn't push yourself up the initial learning curve for these technologies when you first had the chance.\n\nAnd I've been there, so I get it.\n\nBack when I started out, I think it took me a _year_ after being introduced to the basic principles of unit testing and doing some short online courses to _actually_ start systematically including unit tests in my work (rather than just adding a few token tests that were easy to write).\n\nI was a lone data scientist working with a small team of engineers; I found it hard because tests in software engineering don't perfectly map onto tests in data science. But at the end of the day, they would help me, but weren't going to spend their very limited time _making_ me do it right. Freedom is responsibility; you have to have a growth mindset and push yourself, because no-one else will.\n\nFortunately, all is not lost. If the best time to plant a tree was fifty years ago, the second best time is now. Even just that process of reviewing what these ML Engineers are doing is going to help you a tonne; more important will be undertaking to follow best-practices yourself from now on.\n\nIf you can carve out some time to take some online courses, you may find the structure helpful (plus paying for teaching encourages you to get the most from it!)\n\nI think you will be pleasantly surprised by how quickly you pick up most 'technical' skills if you commit to this. Machine learning engineering is a maturing discipline: a lot of people have put a lot of effort into making the tooling progressively easier to use. The sheer volume of stuff to learn is intimidating - but how would you eat an elephant? One bite at a time.",

If you feel like you're very advanced, you're learning a lot & you're enjoying the process, I wouldn't worry about it. For me, sometimes it's nice to bounce between multiple things, other times, especially when I don't have the fundamentals of something, I will focus on just that one thing.\n\nIf you're just starting out, I'd focus on building good fundamentals with your statistics and technology. That really means being comfortable with basic exploratory data analysis and variable space manipulation first, before any sort of modeling. You will do this most likely in either R or Python, maybe both. Pick one of the many datasets either that are default to the libraries in your language of choice, or pick one from the Internet. Calculate some means, create some scatter plots, make some count tables or box plots. Learn how the data was collected. Write down some questions you want to answer. Figure out how to tell a story with what you have. Then, write down what you wish you could do if you could collect more data and specify what that collection might look like. This will teach you the science of data, which I think is a good way to start approaching the field. Most of the other techniques and technologies sort of sit on top of this foundation.\n\nThis is how I'd do it if I was starting out anyway. Plenty of good books out there to guide you too. I'd focus on predictive modeling and applied data analysis first. Some good books you could look at first are Applied Predictive Modeling, Hands-on ML with Keras and TensorFlow, and R for Marketing Research and Analytics. The third one can be substituted for any book you feel is either written better or matches your domain expertise more, but I think it is a great start.",
            "My advice to juniors is to get good at the basics. As a hiring manager, I can't tell you how many candidates I interview coming out of either bootcamps or data science masters that struggle with basic questions about SQL, or who have no sense of how to write moderately clean code, or just can't describe in simple language how they would approach an analysis / modeling problem.\n\nIt's very easy to get distracted by the flashy stuff in the news, but outside of some specific industries most of the jobs you're going to be interviewing for are going to boil down to being able to pull data from some type of data warehouse / data lake, do some cleaning in your team's preferred language (aka Python), and produce either an analysis or a simple model that you'll need to present to your team and/or your business stakeholders.\n\nAnything beyond the basics, learn on the job.\n\nThis advice applies less if you want to work in a specific field, but if you're just trying to break into the industry, you're much better off being a generalist and casting a wide net. From there, it's much easier to move to more specific roles, with more specific knowledge requirements, once you have some experience on your resume."

Most of our applicants have 6-9 years of experience in roles titled as Data Analytics/Data Science/Data Engineering across notable companies and brands like Walmart, Ford, Accenture, Amazon, Ulta, Macy's, Nike, etc.\n\nThe nature of our interviews is fairly simple - we have a brief phone call on theory and foundation of data analytics, and then have a couple of technical interviews focusing on programming and basic data analysis. The interview doesn't cover anything out of the ordinary for most analysts (not even data scientists), and focuses on basic data analysis practices (filter down a column given a set of requirements, get a count of uniques, do basic EDA and explain how to manage outliers). \n\nAll interviewees are told they can use Google as we don't expect people to memorize the syntax, but we do expect them to have at least working knowledge of the tools we expect them to use. The interviews are all remote and don't require in-person meeting. The interviews are basically screen share of Google Colab where we run basic analysis.\n\nIn our recent hiring spree, out of the 7 potential candidates we interviewed, we caught 4 of them cheating.\n\nGiven their profile, I'm a bit amazed that they resorted to cheating. Whether it was by having someone else on the call helping them answer the question, or having someone entirely different answer their questions, and other notable methods that I don't want to share that we caught while they were sharing their screens. I've learned from my colleagues that there are actual *agencies* in India and China who offer interview 'assistance' services.\n\nAt this stage, our leadership is planning to require all potential candidates to be local - this eliminates remote option. On the same token, those cheaters passing the recruiter screening are quite frankly just making it worse for people who are actually capable. Questions become more theoretical and quite specific to industry, scope of hiring will be limited to people within specific domains, and improptu coding tests will be given out without heads up to hinder people from cheating and setting up whatever they do to cheat.\n\n/endrant",

My current data science team is quite mature in business understanding and dissecting the problem to its bone before coming up with an analytical solution, either ML or otherwise; but now it is under pressure to spit out predictive models whose outputs are as good as flukes in production, only because management wants to ride the AI ML bandwagon.\n\nEdit: They do not directly report to me, the VP level has interviewed them and hired them under their tutelage to make them data-smart.

Most managers know there\u2019s a decent learning curve and they\u2019re okay with that, just make sure to ask questions whenever you hit a wall (try googling and figuring it out for yourself first as this will accelerate your learning) - asking questions will be super important at this stage for 2 reasons: a) it\u2019ll help those on your team and your manager better grasp what areas you understand and which ones you need the most help in so they can tailor training and tasks for you around this and b) it\u2019ll show them that while you aren\u2019t contributing a ton yet that you\u2019re still engaged and actively learning which will lead to way more leeway when it comes to the time they give you to get up to speed since they know you\u2019re genuinely putting in the effort. \n\n\n\n\n\nAs for SQL it\u2019s not too bad. What helped me was leading the form of a SQL query (SELECT, FROM, WHERE, GROUP BY, HAVING, and ORDER BY in that order) and then thinking what I need (or which of those are not needed) for the query I have in mind.\n\n\n\n\n\nSo basically in essence just relax, you\u2019ve got more time than you think to pick it up and as long as you show that you\u2019re engaged and trying to learn you\u2019ll most likely be given the time and support needed to pick it up.

I'm supposed to understand and take delivery of their work. The problem is what they do seems like scam to me. I try to raise awareness about it, but leadership seems not to care too much. Their code is trash, and they manipulate their model performance and present it through fancy slides and well-spoken presenters so that it looks acceptable. To give you an example, they fine-tune their models on the test set and squeeze the hell out of it and then say their model will generalize well to future data because of this performance on the test set. Most surprisingly, they improvise and invent new ways to evaluate the performance by, for example calculating precision and recall in a weird way that doesn't make sense.

        "content": "Edit1: Thank you all for the comments. I saw some really good advice that I am going to think about and share with my colleagues. To the comments suggesting \"to just leave\" - The company culture, projects and team is a dream. I have not seen more than 2-3 people leave in last 5-6 years I have been here. I am not planning a move anytime soon since I love the work and overall culture. However, I need a productive way to deal with situation.\n\nSome other clarification - we are not being asked to train \"data analyst\" I would rather prefer that. We are being asked to train people who don't code and use an automated software to pick and dump data.\n\n\\----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nOld manager (data scientist) left and now a manager from data management is managing our team. He doesn't understand the project process or requirements. He trying to change a lot of things and one thing he is consistently focusing on is our salaries. He has repeatedly made comments that \"this\" (data science and analytics) team is paid more than other teams and he doesn't see why that's the case. In one one-on-one meeting he mentioned that there are many people on a certain level and company would not be able to support promoting everyone at these salaries hence we need to think about how to replace them once these people quit due to no promotions. We haven't had much luck while trying to hire external people (lack of good candidates). He insisted that we need to hire and train juniors from his team on data science process so that they can catch up and deliver when the time comes. His older team (data management) team works on selecting and filtering data, they have no experience or business understanding of the process. I resisted and mentioned that it's hard enough to find someone with basic knowledge and up-skill them to level they can deliver projects. It would be a very long and frustrating process to train people who have no background in statistics. Also, it would easily take 1-2 years before they can independently take charge to execute things and we should hire at a position if the person doesn't at-least has some basic knowledge or some hands on projects. I also proposed bootcamps/professional trainings. But he was insisting on personal training from current employees.\n\nHow to deal with this? He is expecting us to train people one on one so they can potentially replace us? He is one of the person who oversees the appraisals however there is a person above him managing the department as well, we don't have direct connects with this person so no idea what he know what he doesn't. What are your views/suggestions on dealing with this without stepping on anyone toes?",

            "That's tough. \n\nIn that situation I would put together a list of the minimum skills I would expect someone to have before I could start training them.\n\nI'd emphasize that I can train someone on our process but am not really equipped to teach someone the basic prerequisites.  If they insist on me teaching people basics, then I need to dedicate some percentage of my time, say 50% over the next 2 years, and need to push out project deadlines accordingly. I'd argue that it would be more cost effective to send someone to classes/a bootcamp to bring them up to the basic level.",
            "Sounds like a toxic new boss in the making who just wants to fill up his new team with familiar faces. I don't have a similar experience but some advice I would give:\n1) Document everything, after every meeting with him summarise the talking points/follow ups and email it to him. If you end up having to complain to his boss this will be really useful because it won't be he said she said, if he doesn't respond with a correction it means he is acknowledging it.\n2) If he wants you guys to train other people, that is fine but then your work needs to move to make space for that. If he is insisting that everything still be completed on time I would push back and ask for a priority list. Basically make him choose. Document his choice too! \n3) It sounds like you know a lot more than him about your jobs. He will probably make unreasonable requests at some point, in that situation try not to get angry, just calmly push back and explain what is realistic and what is not. This goes back to point 1, you want to come off as professional as possible. It doesn't sound like he can actually do your jobs so he still needs to rely on you guys to complete things. \n\nYou will probably need to escalate at some point, hopefully his boss is more reasonable and you have a good foundation to make your case. Otherwise I would think about moving elsewhere at that point.",
            "What I read: Your new boss has made an explicit statement that he is literally planning to replace all of you with lower cost people.\n\nIf you are adding high value (let's call it ten times your salary worth of efficiency or market advantages) and a strong relationship with senior management, ask them outright if their strategic plan is consistent with what your manager told you.\n\nIf not, or if you get an adverse response to that, then:\n\n1. Quietly let the team know, if they don't, that this is in progress.\n2. Apply for jobs elsewhere.\n3. Devote your energy and creative effort towards finding other opportunities.\n4. Work to rule. Stop contributing creatively. Do what you're instructed to do, nothing more.\n5. Stop arguing the point with the manager. Get your role specification and/or original job ad, let him know that once he gets his preferred team to the level of education and experience it specifies you'll be able to conduct transition. I'd go so far as to tell your  it'd be professionally questionable for you to give him the impression that your replacements would be able to perform the specified duties without the prior education and experience and that you're not an educator who can provide that extremely high level of training.\n\nThere is no 'dealing with this without stepping on toes' when they're showing you the knife they plan to drive into your back. Unless you get an ironclad contract from senior management guaranteeing at least 2 years of employment, your time there is done.\n\nThe positive thing here is that it's rare to get this much explicit warning to give you time to prepare accordingly.\n\nOR/ Unionise. Not even kidding here. If the whole team agrees to act together, what more do you need? What are they going to do, fire you? Negotiate a transition plan which works out to double salary for everyone impacted for as long as any of you are engaged there, plus insurance for 12 months afterwards if you're in the American capitalist hellhole."

Let me show you these cool APIs. \n\n \n\n# Scikit-learn Display API Introduction\n\n### Use utils.discovery.all_displays to find available APIs\n\n Scikit-learn (sklearn) always adds Display APIs in new releases, so it's key to know what's available in your version. \n\n Sklearn's [utils.discovery.all\\_displays](https://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/generated/sklearn.utils.discovery.all_displays.html?ref=dataleadsfuture.com#sklearn.utils.discovery.all_displays) lets you see which classes you can use. \n\n    from sklearn.utils.discovery import all_displays\n    \n    displays = all_displays()\n    displays\n\n For example, in my Scikit-learn 1.4.0, these classes are available: \n\n    [('CalibrationDisplay', sklearn.calibration.CalibrationDisplay),\n     ('ConfusionMatrixDisplay',\n      sklearn.metrics._plot.confusion_matrix.ConfusionMatrixDisplay),\n     ('DecisionBoundaryDisplay',\n      sklearn.inspection._plot.decision_boundary.DecisionBoundaryDisplay),\n     ('DetCurveDisplay', sklearn.metrics._plot.det_curve.DetCurveDisplay),\n     ('LearningCurveDisplay', sklearn.model_selection._plot.LearningCurveDisplay),\n     ('PartialDependenceDisplay',\n      sklearn.inspection._plot.partial_dependence.PartialDependenceDisplay),\n     ('PrecisionRecallDisplay',\n      sklearn.metrics._plot.precision_recall_curve.PrecisionRecallDisplay),\n     ('PredictionErrorDisplay',\n      sklearn.metrics._plot.regression.PredictionErrorDisplay),\n     ('RocCurveDisplay', sklearn.metrics._plot.roc_curve.RocCurveDisplay),\n     ('ValidationCurveDisplay',\n      sklearn.model_selection._plot.ValidationCurveDisplay)]\n\n### Using inspection.DecisionBoundaryDisplay for decision boundaries\n\n Since we mentioned it, let's start with decision boundaries. \n\n If you use Matplotlib to draw them, it's a hassle: \n\n* Use np.linspace to set coordinate ranges;\n* Use plt.meshgrid to calculate the grid;\n* Use plt.contourf to draw the decision boundary fill;\n* Then use plt.scatter to plot data points.\n\n Now, with  [inspection.DecisionBoundaryDispla](https://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/generated/sklearn.inspection.DecisionBoundaryDisplay.html?ref=dataleadsfuture.com#sklearn-inspection-decisionboundarydisplay), you can simplify this process: \n\n    from sklearn.inspection import DecisionBoundaryDisplay\n    from sklearn.datasets import load_iris\n    from sklearn.svm import SVC\n    from sklearn.pipeline import make_pipeline\n    from sklearn.preprocessing import StandardScaler\n    import matplotlib.pyplot as plt\n    \n    iris = load_iris(as_frame=True)\n    X = iris.data[['petal length (cm)', 'petal width (cm)']]\n    y = iris.target\n    \n    \n    svc_clf = make_pipeline(StandardScaler(), \n                            SVC(kernel='linear', C=1))\n    svc_clf.fit(X, y)\n    \n    display = DecisionBoundaryDisplay.from_estimator(svc_clf, X, \n                                                     grid_resolution=1000,\n                                                     xlabel=\"Petal length (cm)\",\n                                                     ylabel=\"Petal width (cm)\")\n    plt.scatter(X.iloc[:, 0], X.iloc[:, 1], c=y, edgecolors='w')\n    plt.title(\"Decision Boundary\")\n    plt.show()\n\n See the final effect in the figure: \n\n[ Use DecisionBoundaryDisplay to draw a triple classification model. ](https://preview.redd.it/501h2r27b1qc1.png?width=665&format=png&auto=webp&s=f3614719f48e74c6aabd0d0754c6b08b80f87d02)\n\n Remember, Display can only draw 2D, so make sure your data has only two features or reduced dimensions. \n\n### Using calibration.CalibrationDisplay for probability calibration\n\n To compare classification models, probability calibration curves show how confident models are in their predictions. \n\n Note that  [CalibrationDisplay](https://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/generated/sklearn.calibration.CalibrationDisplay.html?ref=dataleadsfuture.com#sklearn.calibration.CalibrationDisplay) uses the model's  predict\\_proba. If you use a support vector machine, set probability to True: \n\n    from sklearn.calibration import CalibrationDisplay\n    from sklearn.model_selection import train_test_split\n    from sklearn.datasets import make_classification\n    from sklearn.ensemble import HistGradientBoostingClassifier\n    \n    X, y = make_classification(n_samples=1000,\n                               n_classes=2, n_features=5,\n                               random_state=42)\n    X_train, X_test, y_train, y_test = train_test_split(X, y, \n                                                        test_size=0.3, random_state=42)\n    proba_clf = make_pipeline(StandardScaler(), \n                              SVC(kernel=\"rbf\", gamma=\"auto\", \n                                  C=10, probability=True))\n    proba_clf.fit(X_train, y_train)\n    \n    CalibrationDisplay.from_estimator(proba_clf, \n                                                X_test, y_test)\n    \n    hist_clf = HistGradientBoostingClassifier()\n    hist_clf.fit(X_train, y_train)\n    \n    ax = plt.gca()\n    CalibrationDisplay.from_estimator(hist_clf,\n                                      X_test, y_test,\n                                      ax=ax)\n    plt.show()\n\n[ Charts drawn by CalibrationDisplay. ](https://preview.redd.it/ovcp8hcgb1qc1.png?width=599&format=png&auto=webp&s=93515b81145abbb70424dcc69bf0cf8569ac4e3a)\n\n### Using metrics.ConfusionMatrixDisplay for confusion matrices\n\n When assessing classification models and dealing with imbalanced data, we look at precision and recall. \n\n These break down into TP, FP, TN, and FN \u2013 a confusion matrix. \n\n To draw one, use  [metrics.ConfusionMatrixDisplay](https://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/generated/sklearn.metrics.ConfusionMatrixDisplay.html?ref=dataleadsfuture.com#sklearn-metrics-confusionmatrixdisplay). It's well-known, so I'll skip the details. \n\n    from sklearn.datasets import fetch_openml\n    from sklearn.ensemble import RandomForestClassifier\n    from sklearn.metrics import ConfusionMatrixDisplay\n    \n    digits = fetch_openml('mnist_784', version=1)\n    X, y = digits.data, digits.target\n    rf_clf = RandomForestClassifier(max_depth=5, random_state=42)\n    rf_clf.fit(X, y)\n    \n    ConfusionMatrixDisplay.from_estimator(rf_clf, X, y)\n    plt.show()\n\n[ Charts drawn with ConfusionMatrixDisplay. ](https://preview.redd.it/tfbcdin8f1qc1.png?width=572&format=png&auto=webp&s=b1eaaf8e085e1cff8bb9c4bd971dade508010390)\n\n### metrics.RocCurveDisplay and metrics.DetCurveDisplay\n\n These two are together because they're often used to evaluate side by side. \n\n [RocCurveDisplay](https://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/generated/sklearn.metrics.RocCurveDisplay.html?ref=dataleadsfuture.com#sklearn.metrics.RocCurveDisplay) compares TPR and FPR for the model. \n\n For binary classification, you want low FPR and high TPR, so the upper left corner is best. The Roc curve bends towards this corner. \n\n Because the Roc curve stays near the upper left, leaving the lower right empty, it's hard to see model differences. \n\n So, we also use [DetCurveDisplay](https://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/generated/sklearn.metrics.DetCurveDisplay.html?ref=dataleadsfuture.com#sklearn.metrics.DetCurveDisplay) to draw a Det curve with FNR and FPR. It uses more space, making it clearer than the Roc curve. \n\n The perfect point for a Det curve is the lower left corner. \n\n    from sklearn.metrics import RocCurveDisplay\n    from sklearn.metrics import DetCurveDisplay\n    \n    X, y = make_classification(n_samples=10_000, n_features=5,\n                               n_classes=2, n_informative=2)\n    X_train, X_test, y_train, y_test = train_test_split(X, y, \n                                                        test_size=0.3, random_state=42,\n                                                        stratify=y)\n    \n    \n    classifiers = {\n        \"SVC\": make_pipeline(StandardScaler(), SVC(kernel=\"linear\", C=0.1, random_state=42)),\n        \"Random Forest\": RandomForestClassifier(max_depth=5, random_state=42)\n    }\n    \n    fig, [ax_roc, ax_det] = plt.subplots(1, 2, figsize=(10, 4))\n    for name, clf in classifiers.items():\n        clf.fit(X_train, y_train)\n        \n        RocCurveDisplay.from_estimator(clf, X_test, y_test, ax=ax_roc, name=name)\n        DetCurveDisplay.from_estimator(clf, X_test, y_test, ax=ax_det, name=name)\n\n[ Comparison Chart of RocCurveDisplay and DetCurveDisplay. ](https://preview.redd.it/odavl54yh1qc1.png?width=884&format=png&auto=webp&s=6408e319b099ce12c3eff70e788ed0224558e099)\n\n### Using metrics.PrecisionRecallDisplay to adjust thresholds\n\n With imbalanced data, you might want to shift recall and precision. \n\n* For email fraud, you want high precision.\n* For disease screening, you want high recall to catch more cases.\n\n You can adjust the threshold, but what's the right amount? \n\n Here, [metrics.PrecisionRecallDisplay](https://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/generated/sklearn.metrics.PrecisionRecallDisplay.html?ref=dataleadsfuture.com#sklearn-metrics-precisionrecalldisplay) can help. \n\n    from xgboost import XGBClassifier\n    from sklearn.datasets import load_wine\n    from sklearn.metrics import PrecisionRecallDisplay\n    \n    wine = load_wine()\n    X, y = wine.data[wine.target<=1], wine.target[wine.target<=1]\n    X_train, X_test, y_train, y_test = train_test_split(X, y, test_size=0.3,\n                                                        stratify=y, random_state=42)\n    \n    xgb_clf = XGBClassifier()\n    xgb_clf.fit(X_train, y_train)\n    \n    PrecisionRecallDisplay.from_estimator(xgb_clf, X_test, y_test)\n    plt.show()\n\n[ Charting xgboost model evaluation using PrecisionRecallDisplay.  ](https://preview.redd.it/8giy5tr8i1qc1.png?width=489&format=png&auto=webp&s=06b96373c182f515a655d6f4029f44982c87b05d)\n\n This shows that models following Scikit-learn's design can be drawn, like xgboost here. Handy, right? \n\n### Using metrics.PredictionErrorDisplay for regression models\n\n We've talked about classification, now let's talk about regression. \n\n Scikit-learn's [metrics.PredictionErrorDisplay](https://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/generated/sklearn.metrics.PredictionErrorDisplay.html?ref=dataleadsfuture.com#sklearn-metrics-predictionerrordisplay) helps assess regression models. \n\n    from sklearn.svm import SVR\n    from sklearn.metrics import PredictionErrorDisplay\n    \n    rng = np.random.default_rng(42)\n    X = rng.random(size=(200, 2)) * 10\n    y = X[:, 0]**2 + 5 * X[:, 1] + 10 + rng.normal(loc=0.0, scale=0.1, size=(200,))\n    \n    reg = make_pipeline(StandardScaler(), SVR(kernel='linear', C=10))\n    reg.fit(X, y)\n    \n    fig, axes = plt.subplots(1, 2, figsize=(8, 4))\n    PredictionErrorDisplay.from_estimator(reg, X, y, ax=axes[0], kind=\"actual_vs_predicted\")\n    PredictionErrorDisplay.from_estimator(reg, X, y, ax=axes[1], kind=\"residual_vs_predicted\")\n    plt.show()\n\n[Two charts were drawn by PredictionErrorDisplay.](https://preview.redd.it/9uxuobuti1qc1.png?width=764&format=png&auto=webp&s=7db276b2a7d637cf53887e4cebe87b9a23593b9b)\n\n As shown, it can draw two kinds of graphs. The left shows predicted vs. actual values \u2013 good for linear regression. \n\n However, not all data is perfectly linear. For that, use the right graph. \n\n It compares real vs. predicted differences, a residuals plot. \n\n This plot's banana shape suggests our data might not fit linear regression. \n\n Switching from a linear to an rbf kernel can help. \n\n    reg = make_pipeline(StandardScaler(), SVR(kernel='rbf', C=10))\n\n[ A visual demonstration of the improved model performance.  ](https://preview.redd.it/fsu1yqg0j1qc1.png?width=763&format=png&auto=webp&s=860447d0c8a1c0c38539f5fac16998ed928c8714)\n\n See, with rbf, the residual plot looks better. \n\n### Using model_selection.LearningCurveDisplay for learning curves\n\n After assessing performance, let's look at optimization with [LearningCurveDisplay](https://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/generated/sklearn.model_selection.LearningCurveDisplay.html?ref=dataleadsfuture.com#sklearn.model_selection.LearningCurveDisplay).\n\n  First up, learning curves \u2013 how well the model generalizes with different training and testing data, and if it suffers from variance or bias. \n\n As shown below, we compare a DecisionTreeClassifier and a GradientBoostingClassifier to see how they do as training data changes. \n\n    from sklearn.tree import DecisionTreeClassifier\n    from sklearn.ensemble import GradientBoostingClassifier\n    from sklearn.model_selection import LearningCurveDisplay\n    \n    X, y = make_classification(n_samples=1000, n_classes=2, n_features=10,\n                               n_informative=2, n_redundant=0, n_repeated=0)\n    \n    tree_clf = DecisionTreeClassifier(max_depth=3, random_state=42)\n    gb_clf = GradientBoostingClassifier(n_estimators=50, max_depth=3, tol=1e-3)\n    \n    train_sizes = np.linspace(0.4, 1.0, 10)\n    fig, axes = plt.subplots(1, 2, figsize=(10, 4))\n    LearningCurveDisplay.from_estimator(tree_clf, X, y,\n                                        train_sizes=train_sizes,\n                                        ax=axes[0],\n                                        scoring='accuracy')\n    axes[0].set_title('DecisionTreeClassifier')\n    LearningCurveDisplay.from_estimator(gb_clf, X, y,\n                                        train_sizes=train_sizes,\n                                        ax=axes[1],\n                                        scoring='accuracy')\n    axes[1].set_title('GradientBoostingClassifier')\n    plt.show()\n\n[ Comparison of the learning curve of two different models. ](https://preview.redd.it/2ljyfl9aj1qc1.png?width=896&format=png&auto=webp&s=7d7af8bd8a4295c54f6f5c3ce41caf2fd2ddb0c1)\n\n The graph shows that although the tree-based GradientBoostingClassifier maintains good accuracy on the training data, its generalization capability on test data does not have a significant advantage over the DecisionTreeClassifier. \n\n### Using model_selection.ValidationCurveDisplay for visualizing parameter tuning\n\n So, for models that don't generalize well, you might try adjusting the model's regularization parameters to tweak its performance. \n\n The traditional approach is to use tools like GridSearchCV or Optuna to tune the model, but these methods only give you the overall best-performing model and the tuning process is not very intuitive. \n\n For scenarios where you want to adjust a specific parameter to test its effect on the model, I recommend using [model\\_selection.ValidationCurveDisplay](https://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/generated/sklearn.model_selection.ValidationCurveDisplay.html?ref=dataleadsfuture.com#sklearn.model_selection.ValidationCurveDisplay) to visualize how the model performs as the parameter changes. \n\n    from sklearn.model_selection import ValidationCurveDisplay\n    from sklearn.linear_model import LogisticRegression\n    \n    param_name, param_range = \"C\", np.logspace(-8, 3, 10)\n    lr_clf = LogisticRegression()\n    \n    ValidationCurveDisplay.from_estimator(lr_clf, X, y,\n                                          param_name=param_name,\n                                          param_range=param_range,\n                                          scoring='f1_weighted',\n                                          cv=5, n_jobs=-1)\n    plt.show()\n\n[ Fine-tuning of model parameters plotted with ValidationCurveDisplay. ](https://preview.redd.it/5dcgo35jj1qc1.png?width=634&format=png&auto=webp&s=ed3d587e59d31902951ba0c9869ccd2bc39476d4)\n\n&#x200B;\n\n# Some regrets\n\n After trying out all these Displays, I must admit some regrets: \n\n \n\n* The biggest one is that most of these APIs lack detailed tutorials, which is probably why they're not well-known compared to Scikit-learn's thorough documentation.\n* These APIs are scattered across various packages, making it hard to reference them from a single place.\n* The code is still pretty basic. You often need to pair it with Matplotlib's APIs to get the job done. A typical example is DecisionBoundaryDisplay  \n, where after plotting the decision boundary, you still need Matplotlib to plot the data distribution.\n* They're hard to extend. Besides a few methods validating parameters, it's tough to simplify my model visualization process with tools or methods; I end up rewriting a lot.\n\n I hope these APIs get more attention, and as versions upgrade, visualization APIs become even easier to use. \n\n \n\n# Conclusion\n\n In the journey of machine learning, explaining models with visualization is as important as training them. \n\n This article introduced various plotting APIs in the current version of scikit-learn. \n\n With these APIs, you can simplify some Matplotlib code, ease your learning curve, and streamline your model evaluation process. \n\n Due to length, I didn't expand on each API. If interested, you can check the [official documentation](https://scikit-learn.org/stable/visualizations.html?ref=dataleadsfuture.com) for more details. \n\n Now it's your turn. What are your expectations for visualizing machine learning methods? Feel free to leave a comment and discuss. \n\n This article was originally published on my personal blog [Data Leads Future](https://www.dataleadsfuture.com/scikit-learn-visualization-guide-making-models-speak/).

I\u2019m also a competent programmer, but I\u2019m certainly not at the computer science or software developer level. I can write R or Python code which gets the job done but it isn\u2019t always pretty, and will often google for solutions.

Sometimes I\u2019ll work with inferential stats (e.g. using chi squared), and permutation testing. Then I\u2019ll be doing predictive modelling and use something like logistic regression. \n\nEach time, I understand how these techniques work in terms of the mathematics, but by the time I come to look at them again, I\u2019ve forgotten at least some of it.

Do I need know all of these well to be a good data scientist, or is it typical to end up \u201cspecialising\u201d in one or two areas (E.g. predictive modelling, forecasting), depending on where you work?\n\nOn a side note - do I need to have a solid personal profile (E.g. GitHub projects) to do well in my career, or once I\u2019ve got experience is that less relevant?

I made it mostly for myself initially and some of the explanations later on are more my stream of consciousness than anything else but I figured I'd share anyway in case it is helpful for anyone. At worst, it at least is like an ordered walkthrough of NLP stuff\n\nI'm sure there's tons of typos or just some things I wrote that I misunderstood so any comments or corrects are welcome, you can feel free to message me and I'll make the changes.\n\nIt's mostly just meant as a public resource and I'm not getting anything from this (don't mean for this to come across as self-promotion or anything) but yeah, have a look!\n\n[www.nlpbegin.com](https://www.nlpbegin.com/)",

Additionally, you've also covered neural nets and other pre-requisites. Great work, man! Will share this across my circle as well :)",

        "content": "In my entire career, I have never had a single manager that provided any value to me personally. Here's a recap of all of the managers I've had in my career. \n\n\n1. Terrific manager. Hired me, made me feel welcome, immediately left the company two weeks after I started\n\n\n\n2. Replaced first manager, and immediately put me on performance improvement plan to try and get rid of me. Would find formatting errors, any sort of mistake or human error at all to tell me that I was a sloppy employee. Completely ignored any benefit I provided, and had no interest in working with me. Just wanted to build their own team, and I was in their way because I was already there\n\n\n3. Hired me, and instead letting me get oriented into my role, decided to do what she called \"trial by fire\", just throw me into the deep and and see if I sink or swim. I excelled in my position, did everything better than expected, received praise often, but passed up for a promotion because only one person can be promoted. \n\n\n4. Completely incompetent, never actually did any of the subject that they were managing a team for. Ended up being fired for sexual harassment against many women on our team \n\n\n\n5. Came from another team to replace previous manager, gave me mountains of work and impossible goals and expectations to achieve, and even when achieving them, made up a bunch of excuses as to why I can't be promoted that made no sense. Glass ceiling, basically, can't be promoted unless you tell me that you want to be promoted, and X amount of years have passed, need X amount of outstanding performance reviews, etc\n\n\n6. Actually a really good manager and all around good person. For the first year, great to work under them, they let me get situated in the role, let me get exposure to many different teams and departments, let me explore and provided coaching. However, after the first year, became very lazy as a manager. Never at their desk, always driving somewhere, scheduling meetings and then being 15 plus minutes late to them because again, they are driving somewhere, or not doing their job. Became extremely lazy and let errors slip through their fingers, and blame team members for them. Began making excuses when people wanted to be promoted \n\n\n7. The director above the previous manager in bullet point above. Completely worthless leader who came aboard to replace another director, and their first mission was to interrogate everyone on the team, and determine if their career goals were to stay in their current position. Anyone who desired career growth, or wanted to move up into management, or had career aspirations was immediately let go because they're \"Not a fit for our organizational goals\" \n\n\n\nThe most common thing I have seen is that it is impossible to get promoted. Most positions at analyst level are designed so that no one can proceed into other positions because they want you to stay exactly where you are currently and not move up, they try to make it as difficult as possible for you to move up into other roles in the company. If you don't want to sit exactly where you are for at least 5 to 10 years, you're a bad employee, and there is no way to be promoted.",

I\u2019ve always thought you could get rid of half the managers and save a bunch of company money and output and morale might improve. I\u2019ve resisted becoming a manager because so many are useless and make the job look some weird combo of boring and stressful.",
            "Have had similar experiences, which is what made me think I could do a decent job as a manager. I saw a nice set of requirements to be a decent manager on this subreddit at some point that stuck with me: understand the work well, don't be a jerk, and care about developing your people. So many managers fail at least one of these. \n\nRegarding promotions, you must be able and willing to take a job somewhere else if you aren't happy. It is hard to be promoted if you have no leverage.",

Have a few research projects using pytorch I did during my masters. Also obviously proficient with mathematical statistics and probability, the stuff you get from a stats ms.\n\n\u200b\n\nInternship stuff:\n\nLots of people asked or brought up my internship, so I'll ad more about it. The company manages a large databse of college athletes and recruits and sells access and analysis to athletic programs. I joined as an intern winter of 2022, working part time during my masters. It's a small company with 10 full time employees, completely remote. There is one other programmer/tech guy but he mostly does does pandas/web-scraping/social media automation stuff, no stats/ml. There aren't any other data science/machine learning/stats people at the company, the owner/ceo has some experience and recently worked on a data sciency project but I think he spends most of his time managing the business. For the first 8 months I was essentially a software engineer/data engineer, writing python code to scrape and clean and move datasets. Last fall I started building a system that uses an llm to automate a monthly data entry project. This project was recurring every month, and usually took a group of 6 interns and 3 full time employees about a week to finish. My system now automates between 60% and 80% of it each month, most months its closer to 80%. The project is now typically done by two full time employees and maybe 1 intern. I'm now working on a project using boosted trees to find under/over recruited athletes. The owner/ceo of the company said I can add whatever title for my internship to my resume, since its a small company there aren't officially designated tracks or titles. I'm currently using \"Data Science Intern - Machine Learning\", but can change this to anything as long as it still accurately reflects what I've been doing.\n\n\u200b\n\nAcademic Stuff:\n\nThesis focused on self-attention in NMT and image classification, essentially showed that the common interpretation of self-attention working by \"comparing words in the input\" is wrong. Currently my advisor and I are working on extending the research, he wants to try to publish and so do I. 3.5 gpa in masters program (I know this isn't great but the school has a reputation for being hard/rigorous with no grade inflation, so maybe I'll be ok?). Undergrad GPA was 3.9, 4.0 if we only look at my major (few A- grades in humanities requirements). Was in honors program, wrote an honors thesis in math (algebraic geometry), got the \"best math student\" awards from my math department junior and senior year. I know since I have a master's the undergrad stuff is less important, but maybe that will help because it was a large non-elite university, mostly known for sports.",

Coupled with ever increasing graduation rates with more targeted degrees.\n\n2. Lack of recruiters. The hiring dept/recruiters were hit hard during this tech recession. So there\u2019s just fewer people managing all of the interviews and resumes. So there\u2019s fewer people managing the application process and even higher number of applications to sort through.\n\n3. It\u2019s summer. Lots of people are on vacation and so everything slows down. \n\n4. Ghost posts. Places leave job listings up in case some magical unicorn applicant happens to apply, but they are not very actively fielding interviews.\n\nThese are just some guesses. Very little data to support it. But it\u2019s not just you, even people who have been in the field a while aren\u2019t having an easy time.",

I also do agree that the market is kinda saturated right now, but it is not saturated with any sort of quality. Almost every university offers some cheap business analytics masters that teaches some SQL and some BI and these people graduate and start applying to DS jobs. Combine that with the fact that a lot of tech recruiters have been laid off, and there is just a lot of garbage to cut through for the recruiters who are left.\n\nAll you need is your foot in the door and you'll be in good shape. Keep applying and sharpening your skills. Maybe consider working with an agency to help you get that first interview.",

Whatever I say is usually twice how long I actually think it will take, because things never go like you think.\n* Make it clear that that longer-term estimates will be less accurate the farther out they are, because software is notoriously difficult to estimate.\n* Tell them to their face that we *will not* make the unrealistic dates they've set, and to prevent in future to always consult first.\n* I will *not* work overtime due to artificial deadlines. I'll do O/T for extreme exceptional cases only, such as a one-time short-term crisis or for a regulatory-mandated deadline. By 6pm I'll be at my house.\n* Explain quality should never be abandoned for speed. It will violently backfire in the end, with the opposite effect.\n\nI stand my ground.

            "> Give realistic estimates on how long things will take. Whatever I say is usually twice how long I actually think it will take, because things never go like you think.\n\nThis is a constant struggle with data. My intuition in how long a program will take is generally a wild deviation from how long it actually takes. Because inevitably there are layers of data issues to work through. A process methodology last year involves building maps to compare today to what they were in the prior year. Fixing a data process to provide a necessary component that involves coordination with a second department. The single item on the calendar to work towards includes 25 sub-tasks that each have some special handling considerations.\n\nThe accurate estimates are so far from what my intuition says it should be that it feels embarrassing to share an accurate estimate. That's an internal pressure, I tend to do my harshest critic. I know this. Still, hard to modify toward accuracy.\n\nYou got into build mode. Then meeting jerks you out of it, breaking flow. You come back and clock an inefficiency of time spent working back into flow state again.\n\nIn consulting estimating work is an iterative process. You track it. Check predictions repeat. Find that process helps improve estimates. Still. Rough going.",

            "> Give realistic estimates on how long things will take. Whatever I say is usually twice how long I actually think it will take, because things never go like you think.\n\nThe challenge here is explaining *why* you're giving the dates you're giving.  Business folks hate uncertainty and science by nature deals with a lot of uncertainty. That dynamic alone accounts for probably 80% of the friction between business and science.",

And these companies typically pay less than the ones that know they need ML engineers and MLOps engineers.\n\nEven for data science roles heavy in ML or other modeling, the talent pool includes people with a relatively wider range of backgrounds: CS, math, econ, engineering, etc. which could push down salaries a bit. Generally MLE roles need more software skills. For a lot of applied math grads, for example, DS is the obvious path to go to make money. But CS grads can just do regular software engineering."

        "content": "My background, in case it's relevant: I have a masters and PhD in data science, and I've been in my first data science role for about a year and a half.\n\n\nI am a data scientist in a business intelligence department. When I joined, I inherited an extremely poor churn model - like ~10% precision, ~5% recall, ~91% accurate (due to imbalance). This thing was in production for over a year because my manager didn't realize that accuracy is a poor metric to use for imbalanced data.\n\n\nI've spent the last year and a half redoing this model myself to a place where it is a lot better. But, my manager wants me to present the old model to executives. Now, if this were simply a comparison of the old one and the new one or an examination into why the old one didn't work so well, that would be fine. That's not what he wants. He wants me to present the model as if its predictions are perfect in order to show executives areas that we need to improve on in order to prevent churn.\n\n\nThis... makes no sense. E.g., let's say the old model classified old customers as most at-risk, but it's newer customers who actually churn more. Basing business decisions on the model's poor predictions is a really bad idea. \n\n\nTo be clear, I don't have a problem making these slides. I have pushed back on the idea behind it, but I've never refused to do it. What I'm concerned about is that it's my name that's going on this and it's going to be presented as my sole effort, albeit from within the department, even though it's a model I had no hand in building whatsoever. My boss also has a tendency to throw people under the bus, and I feel like I'm being sacrificed.\n\n\nI see a few options:\n\n\n1. I can carefully word things so that I do not invite any conclusions drawn from my presentation whatsoever and also gently shut down any possible business decisions that might be made from this presentation.\n\n\n2. I present it the way my boss wants but stay honest when anyone asks about the actual churn results and how much they differ from the model.\n\n\nSo basically, my questions are:\n\n\n* Do I need to shut up and do as I'm told and act like a cog in the business machine? \n\n\n* Is this really normal business practice that I need to get used to? \n\n\n* Am I being dramatic?\n\n\n* Or do I right to have a problem with this request? \n\n\nI am coming from academia where every little decision in the modeling process has to be justified and everything gets examined by multiple people, so maybe this is me just struggling to adapt to corporate life.",

            "Your boss wants to cover his ass by using you (the expert) to validate he wasn\u2019t the idiot responsible for putting a terrible model in production for such a long time.\nGet some conclusions that you think are valid (by using the new model for example) and see how you can present mostly the same things with the old model. The higher ups probably don\u2019t understand the details better than your boss and just want some proactive advice about next steps.\nReinforce that you have a newer model in the pipeline that should be better and allow more granular actions.",
            "Yeah this is a big problem in I think most companies. A lot of time analytics outputs are not genuine research to understand a truth (even if they are framed as such). A lot of the time they are just ammunition in a broader agenda.\n\nBelieve it or not, this is not always a bad thing. I used to have a boss who was openly fine with being handed \u2018bad\u2019 analysis. As he put it to me once - \"I know this department is underperforming, but I have no evidence. Just give me something that says how they may be underperforming. If it's flawed, they'll have to disprove it - and that starts a conversation.\" Often the end result is that you kick-start an exploratory process within the business, that eventually results in something much more useful than your initial flawed report.\n\nBut, being used like this as a pawn in a bigger game definitely doesn't help your credibility as a data scientist. You still have to look after yourself, and to do that I generally try and do three things:\n\n1. Distance myself from any work that is not mine. A fairly solid technique I use when people bastardise my output is framing it as not wanting to take personal credit for a collaborative effort. Put the name of your department on it, not your personal name or role.\n2. If my boss still wants me personally associated with the work (for credibility reasons) I will hold firm on not putting my name on the materials, but suggest that I present the work instead. This way at least I get to control the way the narrative is presented.\n3. Deliver what is wanted, but call out the assumptions very clearly. If I am proceeding from the assumption that the old model is correct - I say so. You don't have to say that the emperor has no clothes to protect yourself. You can just highlight that this assumption bears further investigation, or something similarly oblique. Cram it in the appendix or a footnote if you have to. As long as it's documented, you will be OK.\n\nAt the end of the day this is not about producing a paper that passes peer review. It's about delivering what is asked for, and CYA.",
            "Dang I relate to this anxiety coming from academia, especially the \"my name on stuff\" part. I'm too much of a noob to give helpful advice, but is there a way where you can just end on various \"future improvements\" \n\nIs it also possible to ask why they prefer the old model over your newer one? Or would they not be receptive to that?",

            "I've been in a very similar situation once. What I ended up doing was giving a carefully worded presentation that kept my boss happy without outright lying about the model or results. Got a new job and quit very shortly afterwards (largely down to absolute shitshows like this). Told the execs that the actual model produced was awful, riddled with errors, and worse than random guessing. Then, I helped them fix some of the issues with the model in my notice period."

Most the candidates have had a masters qualification in 'data science' and most have had CNN experience listed on their CV. However they have not been able to convincingly answer the following questions:\n\n* You mention CNNs on your CV; can you explain what a convolution is?\n\nThey may talk about masks and 'sliding'  but cannot go into the details of the mathematical operation.\n\n* Can you explain a Type I and Type II error? What is a common trade-off between the two?\n\nComplete blank from all candidates. If I clarify false-positive and false-negative the best candidates point out the importance of context but don't know about trade-offs.\n\n* Your CV lists scikit learn, what is kNN clustering? How might you determine the optimum k parameter?\n\nMost can explain kNN, the best candidates have suggested plotting the clusters with the data and eyeballing it however no-one has mentioned elbow or silhouette plots.\n\nIs it unreasonable to expect solid answers to these questions?\n\nEdit: I've quite rightly got criticism for confusing kNN and k-means. I should clarify that I have misrepresented a question from another interviewer. She sometimes asked if the candidate could explain kNN when it arose in the context of Nan replacement for data cleaning. Other times she asked if they knew about unsupervised learning and when k-means came up she would ask how do you determine k. She never asked about both during the same interview which I now understand was probably intentional but I had assumed she was asking about the same thing.\n\n\nI should also clarify these were intended as 'stretch' questions and the majority of the interview was questions like 'can you tell us about the project you have listed on the application?'. But we felt to distinguish better candidates it was necessary to take them out of their comfort zone.",

            "You are interviewing candidates to gauge whether they will succeed at the job right? In that case, you would want to ask questions to assess their understanding rather than hitting them with 'gotcha' questions. \n\n&nbsp;\n\nQ1. Your candidates probably know enough about CNNs to do the job (I hope). Rarely will someone need to implement a convolution from scratch on the job, but if they do then the details will be important. Not being able to explain convolution mathematically probably wouldn't prevent them from succeeding at the job. Many people can probably get by without knowing the full details - or at least they might know the gist and can get by just fine. For an entry-level position I don't think this should be expected, but for senior (or PhD prereq.) positions most definitely. \n\n&nbsp;\n\n\nQ2. Type I and Type II errors are more in the realm of statistical hypothesis testing. Should the candidate know fundamental statistics? Absolutely. However, I would say getting the jargon (edit: terminology) right is more important if you are dealing with A/B testing. What you are really after is whether your candidate understands the tradeoff between precision and recall. So how about ask them about confusion matrix metrics?\n\n\n&nbsp;\n\nQ3. To clarify, KNN is a supervised learning algorithm. K-means is a clustering algorithm. K is not the same here. In fact, I would be suspicious if someone told me K-means was the unsupervised version of KNN. They are similar in that they are non-parametric algorithms based on a distance metric, but they are completely different algorithms. Now about the elbow method and silhouette plots - these may be simple concepts but data science students rarely come across them let alone unsupervised learning in general. I can see why, there is rarely a practical use case for clustering as clusters more often than not do not appear clear cut like in textbooks. I wouldn't expect a candidate to know about the elbow method but I would be impressed if they do. \n\n\n&nbsp;\n\nIf you are looking for someone with a background more in statistics, I would interview someone with a Masters in statistics or mathematics. However, someone with a Masters in data science or computer science will not necessarily know the details that you are alluding to. Intermediate statistics and above is not a requirement in many of these programs (you can make a case for and against this).",

            "kNN clustering is not a thing.",
            "I would reframe question 2 as explaining precision vs recall.",
            "For fresh Masters candidates yes I would be expecting grad-level answers to these questions which delve into the math/theory embellished with practical examples.\n\nThe lack of theory-based understanding of convolution may be due to how they are covered in a whirlwind of diff layers/architectures in general deep learning courses where there is so much content and the focus is on practical use. More CV-focused programs however would cover it a bit more deeply. However since the job is CV/image based all candidates should have revised it before...\n\nType I/II terminology may be less familiar as false pos/neg is more common in ML\u2014should always be able to bring up recall/precision and explain those.\n\nDo not feel guilty about maintaining minimum standards to fill a high performing role, there's just a lot of \"junk\" on the market in the past few years with DS bootcamps/masters everywhere. Maybe emphasise CV courses in the JD to seek out those who have done more training in CV"

        "comments": [
            "From a data engineer's perspective, average is much easier to compute than median for large datasets.\n\nTo calculate an average for a long list of values, all you need is a sum and a total. The database can read each value once, add it to the sum, then release it from memory and move on. For a median however, you need to sort all the values and find the value in the middle, which requires more compute time and memory. There are a few algorithms that improve this but none of them scale very well.\n\nNone of this matters if you only have 100 or 1,000 values, or if you're doing one-time calculations. But for us, our data analysts ask us to produce reports from tables with millions of records, with live dashboards that constantly get updated. So unless there's a really good reason to use a median instead of a mean, we'll go with the mean.",

How many items/units does the typical order have? You may want to know this because it can impact how you design your ordering system, how you design processes for approvals, etc. In this case, the median will be most helpful - you don't want to design for the tail of the distribution.\n2. How many total units should I expect? You may want to know this to project sales, total units, for planning, manufacturing, etc. In this case, you want the average - you do not want to take out the tail of the distribution because that would systematically underestimate your numbers.",
            "For univariate data, medians ignore extreme values because they are based on order, and means are sensitive to them.  Depending on the question you want to answer (and the data you have), one or the other might be appropriate.  Sometimes both, as in measuring skewness (e.g. Pearson mode skew).\n\nFor bivariate data the median is ... ?  The mean has some advantage here, as it naturally extends to higher dimensions.  The median requires an ordering on the underlying sample space, which does not exist naturally for dimensions greater than one.",

Each has to complete a formal 70/20/10 professional development plan, which is a proposal designed by the employee with manager guidance and then subject to approval from me and the head of our division. The main requirement is that it be connected in some way to improving their productivity in their current role, although I define this very broadly.\n\nMy other big idea to ensure people take advantage of this time allocation was to schedule PD time on Monday mornings, rather than Friday afternoons.

Nothing happened to them they just played dumb until we later caught that they were refusing to push qualified black / hispanic / white candidates to the interview stage. \n\nOur director was tempted to pair all visa holding recruiters with a US citizen but we quickly realized that would be awkward for the US citizen and overall inefficient so we decided to build an analytical dashboard for the higher up people in HR that showed them if / how the recruiters were displaying racial bias in their sourcing process. \n\nMost of the visa holding recruiters who worked with us when we had the LinkedIn issue were let go about 3 months after this dashboard went into production because it became evident that they weren't sourcing candidates based off our DEI initiatives nor were they properly considering the qualifications of the candidates. \n\nHonestly, after having left that roll I've realized that more companies need this type of solution.",

I was raked over the coals a few months ago for apparently bad interview questions but my latest experience blows that out the water. I thought I'd give my experience from the other side of the desk which may go some way to showing why it can be so bad.\n\nI received a message last week saying that an online assessor for a Graduate Data Scientist role had dropped out and they needed volunteers to stand in. I volunteered to help.\n\nSomeone from HR sent me an email with a link to a training video and the interview platform. I watched the 30 min video at 1.5 speed which was mostly stuff like which buttons to press.\n\nThe day before I logged onto the assessment portal I reviewed the questions. I noticed that the questions were very generic but thought there might be some 'calibration' briefing before the interviews; it was too late to speak to HR.\n\nBefore the assessment day there was a HR call 30 mins before. It turned out to be just to check if anyone had technical issues. There was no 'calibration' brief. The call ended after 10 mins as the HR rep had to leave to chase no shows.\n\nI was dropped straight into a 'technical' interview 1 on 1 with the candidate. Although it was apparently technical most of the questions were very generic. E.g. Walk me through a project where you had to solve a problem.\n\nThere were criteria associated with the questions but there was no way you would answer them as the interviewee unless prompted. E.g in the above question a criterion might be 'The candidate readily accepts new ideas'. Given the short time (5 mins per question) it was not really possible to prompt for every criterion but I did try to enable the candidate to score highly but it meant the questioning was very disjointed.\n\nAfter a few of these there was the 'technical' section. These questions seemed to be totally left-field. E.g. you have two identical-size metal cubes how could you differentiate the material they are made of? Obviously this question is useless for the role and the CS-background interviewee needed lots of coaching to answer this.\n\nNext I had a soft skills interview with a different candidate. The questions again were vague and sensible answers would not meet the criteria.\n\nFinally there was a group activity and we were supposed to observe the 'teamwork' but the team just split the tasks and got on with them individually so there was hardly anything to observe.\n\nAfter this the HR bod asked us to complete all the assessments and submit them. Then we'd have a 'wash up'. The wash up was basically the place where scoring could be calibrated by discussing with the other assessors. Of course, the scores had already been submitted by then so this was entirely pointless.\n\nI also asked about the inappropriate technical questions and they said they didn't get the DS questions in time so had just used other technical questions (we were hiring other engineers/scientists at the same time).\n\nSo, as you can see, HR ruin everything they touch and hiring is a HR process so it's terrible.

            "I am not sure about your skills, but as someone who has trained few data analysts and data scientists there are few things I would recommend you to try. \n\n1. Find a good mentor, I have helped people from start to finish on their projects and let them have all the credit. There is no need for me to break someone\u2019s confidence in front of others or have an intention of taking away from their learning experience, be it little or a lot\n\n2. Ask for help early! But first formalize the problem and the possible solution in your head. Also don\u2019t spend more than 3-4 days trying to figure out a problem if you are stuck. Max should be 2. When asking for help again explain what you tried, and be clear on where you are stuck\n\n3. Be vocal about your work, share your work with other departments. If you aren\u2019t getting projects on your team. Ask you manager if he is ok connecting with other teams in the company. You might come across an easy problem that you can develop a solution on your own and showcase that. In some cases that can also help you make a switch to the other team\n\n4. Be an active learner. Business problems can be solved in many ways, so focus on learning the tools of the trade. If you struggle with advanced SQL concepts like CTEs, aggregations, stored procedures then try to learn them. If you are weak in using pandas use more of that. Do not copy and paste someone else\u2019s code, it is a quick fix but will rob you of the learning aspect. We all reuse code and sometimes that is required but that shouldn\u2019t stop you from actively learning new skills\n\n5. I know you don\u2019t want to hear this, but fresh graduates unfortunately do a lot of grunt work, e.g., cleaning data, checking things here and there, sadly even if you have a PHD outside of STEM fields and without experience that first year or so is grunt work. But there is also a silver lining, this allows you time and to get better, and hone your skills \n\n6. I don\u2019t agree with an employee calling another employee \u201cpainfully average\u201d. This is not professional and they should be mentoring you instead of passing on comments like these. We were all painfully average at some point, no one was born writing NNs from scratch as soon as they came out. For me it was the first year. Now according to some people I can still be painfully average as I can\u2019t code in C++, can\u2019t compete with a DS who works at Nvidia, but the point is that you are in the learning stage of your career, and the key is to pay attention on the skills you need to polish and showcase them. If you are not in FAANG then polishing SQL/ Python, and designing a solution to a problem and working it out in your head will take you far! \n\n7. Take notes and record your technical meetings! \n\nIf you have any questions just DM me, I can recommend you books and topics that will help."

        "content": "I'm really not sure how to summarize this concisely in a neat title, so just let me explain.\n\nAt previous lower level jobs, we were organized. We had ticketing tracking systems, step-by-step procedures for all of the commonly done work, we had checklists that people could sign off on as they completed work. And most importantly, even for one-off requests, the primary mode of communication was email. That way, I had the project specifications and/or updates spelled out in front of me that I could refer back to whenever needed.\n\nAs I get higher up in the field at different companies, I'm finding the primary mode of communication is virtual meetings. All of the background, specifications, and next steps are given verbally, and I'm sitting here in these meetings furiously trying to write everything down that is being said. What's worse is that the ideas for the projects often aren't fully developed and we have to figure them out so I get a lot of \"do this, actually no, let's do it this way, but I'm actually thinking it would be better to approach it this way.....\". AS you can imagine it makes fully understanding the next steps of a given projects difficult. If I use my judgement and approach it the way I feel is best, half the time it's end up not being what management wants and I have to waste their time and mine on rework. \n\nOne of the ways I tried to work around management's brain dumps on me was to recap back to them what the next steps they wanted from me were, but they're ***super busy*** so they always join the meetings late, and as a result we frequently run out of time.  75% of the time I try to message or email them with questions they just don't respond, so the only way I can get any info out of them is via virtual meetings. This is creating an environment for me that makes mistakes easier to happen, and it's turning into a situation where I can do 9 things right, but if I missed or misunderstood the 10th thing, I'm getting crucified for it (meanwhile this is a common occurrence for management but that's a different rant.....) I'm being made to feel like it's a shortcoming of mine for not being able to take down everything accurately.\n\nI know some people can thrive in these conditions. For me, it's tough. I'm definitely a scatterbrain and I try to compensate for this by being as organized as humanly possible, but it's just easier said than done when most everything is being given ONLY verbally. I understand that the higher you go in data science, the less routine and the more exploratory and R&D your work becomes, so having clearly documented procedures becomes less realistic. But if this is the way most of these positions are going to be, I really don't feel like this field is for me.",

            "In a lot of ways, pretty much. As you move up the levels, ambiguity increases. To put it in it's most simple terms, vague ideas come from \"higher ups\", seniors or leads take those vague ideas and turn them into concrete plans, more junior people carry out those plans.\n\nThat is obviously a vast, vast oversimplification, but, at its core, it's pretty accurate.\n\nFrom senior level up, I think something you have to be ready for is getting a loosely drawn doodle rather than a blueprint. The major thing is being able to discern what's actually important in amongst, what can amount to a wish list / brain dump. \n\nWhat I'd expect seniors to be able to do is not expect a step by step guide, but know what the core requirements are and be able to get those from stakeholders up front. And then and the confidence and competence to fill in the rest as they see fit. Because often, you will be the best person to do that.\n\nOf course, newly senior people might struggle with this to start with. Just because you can't do this all straight away doesn't mean you'll never get it.\n\nAlso, figuring out how you need to handle people and what form of communication works best to get the best response from people on an individual level is a little mentioned, but crucial part of the role, in my experience.",
            "This is a great question. In my opinion, it's a 50/50 split of: more ambiguity on the one hand, and poor culture of communication on the other. Commenters above have spoken to the former; I'll speak to the latter here.\n\nMy previous job was at a company that used to have tickets, documentation, and well-defined processes for most things. However, the company grew a lot, and that culture deteriorated. Then COVID happened, and people started very aggressively using Zoom. \n\nSomewhat surprisingly, when people needed to meet in person more in order to discuss something, it made it more challenging to just get someone to talk to: you needed to be in the same physical office (which the company had multiple and all over the globe), you had to book a meeting room, and physical meetings would be less numerous than the Zoom ones in general.\n\nWith Zoom, it became very similar to what you're describing, however not only at the higher levels, but for everyone at that company. Basically - everyone's drowning in Zoom calls and so nobody has the time to really think through or document any idea or thought. Some even refer to that as \"chickens running around with their heads cut off\".\n\nNow I moved to another company that's very deliberate about scheduling meetings and such, and it feels much better. I'm back to the world where ideas are better thought through and documented. It's also much better for the physical well-being and lower stress.\n\nCheck the number of Zoom meetings everyone has. If it's more than 2-3 a day, there might be a communications problem. And if so, here's a couple resources to check out:\n\n- Google search \"hyperactive hive mind\" and read all articles by Cal Newport on the subject\n\n- The book called \"It doesn't have to be crazy at work\" describes a culture that's much closer to the one I'm enjoying right now.",
            "This isn\u2019t just senior roles in DS, it\u2019s senior roles. Period. Part of the increased pay is being able to figure out ambiguous instructions without too much handholding.",
            "With seniority comes responsibility, independence and expectation to figure out what needs to be done. To me it seems like you want management to still hold your hand. \n\nWhen they give you a half baked idea it's now your job to figure out what can be done with it and do it.",
            "If your management is leaving before giving you a chance to ask questions, that's a company problem. \n\nBut yes, with seniority comes ambiguity. Eventually you'll get to a point where things are simpler, just because you'll be able to fill in the missing points yourself."

It's a hard time for new grad and after two times of withdrawals of my offers, this is the only one I have in my hands. The job duty is about analyzing campaign performance, analyzing customer patterns, and forecasting business trends.  They are also working on breaking data silos utilizing cloud service so ETL jobs should also be expected.\n\nOverall the project sounds pretty attractive to me. My only concern is the business itself. One of my friends (not in US) gave me a strong suggestion that don't easily go into this industry. He was working in an operation role for company building mobile casinos, and the business logic was so different from other industries that it's hard to get out of this. Many people have a bias toward this career so he had a hard time changing jobs.\n\nI am scared, to be honest. But I am not sure to what extent his thoughts work in my scenario. Casino Resort still looks much different from mobile casinos and his role was not data analyst. I wonder how you guys think about this.  Should I take this offer?",

I lost my confidence completely once I was put on a PIP and quit my job the next day. I don't have a job right now. \n\nI feel it's really hard but not impossible to bounce back from this \"failure\". First of all, I'm taking some time off to take care of my physical and mental health by doing strength training, meditation and Yoga, working on my diet, spending time with family etc. \n\nSecondly, I'm trying to focus on my strengths (computer vision and deep learning) and working on toy problems related to object detection and segmentation to get my mojo back. But the sheer amount of stuff that a data scientist is supposed to know is just too overwhelming for me. \n\nHas anyone experienced something similar? If yes, how did you bounce back from it? I'd love to read your stories.\n\nEdit - Thanks a lot for your comments, suggestions and stories. I will reply to each and everyone of you, but allow me some time.

Don't worry, there are shitty jobs everywhere, and you will feel even better once some time has passed and you realize you aren't defined by that one experience. \n\nBouncing back is probably easier than you think. I wouldn't even describe it as a setback that way -- more that you've just gained some new wisdom from that experience and you are shifting directions. A large number of people persist in shitty jobs and that isn't \"success\" by my metrics. \n\nMy personal experience is I quit a job as a contract data scientist at a toxic company and it was one of the best decisions I could have made for my career. Contractors were exploited and rarely converted to full time, and projects were scrapped left and right. I was so burned out that I knew I would have been PIP'd/fired if I had tried to endure it, so I left, took ~18 months to take care of a sick family member, organized my thoughts, and used the experience to recalibrate my goals. I went back on the job market and eventually landed a great senior data scientist position in my original field (biotech) with full time benefits, a title increase, and a pay raise. I felt more certain about my goals and am very content with the outcome.\n\nIf you have the chops to land a senior data scientist position in the first place, I have no doubt you will be able to find a good position in the future.

And did you end up going back to the US, or did you decide to stay?\n\nThanks!\n\nEdit: Thanks for the great replies so far, really appreciated! If anyone has experience outside of Europe, I'd love to hear more about those as well.",
        "comments": [
            "US citizen working in Spain. Disclaimer to say obviously you\u2019ll need perspectives from different countries to get a clear idea.\n\nFirst, I would recommend trying to find a remote US job. If you have that and permission to move here then you are in great shape. Another option is just to quit and take a year off, assuming you make good money, then come back. You\u2019ll still earn nearly the same $$ over 2 years of working here but it\u2019s obv more of a career risk.\n\nI say this because if you come to mainland Europe and work for a European company, it won\u2019t just be a pay cut, your salary could be more like half of what it was. Getting a job is far tougher than the US because you\u2019ll need someone to sponsor your visa, and the company will legally need demonstrate they tried to hire an EU citizen first (who will gladly accept the lower salary). Not only that but the company will ofc need to be working in English (which is common), but all else equal preference will still go to those who can speak the local language, and job apps often have language requirements too. \n\nAssuming you can land a good job \u2014 the taxes are way higher and you\u2019ll have to deal with US taxes on top of that. The cost of living in a major city really isn\u2019t much cheaper than the US (excl. NYC, SF). I would say the \u201coffice culture\u201d and work/life is pretty much the same - besides being blissfully removed from US politics/culture and everyone around you hailing from Europe, ofc. \n\nIf you can allow yourself to get past all that, it\u2019s wonderful to be in Europe and be able to travel anywhere on weekends. You\u2019ll probably get 25-30 days of vacation and healthcare is free/cheaper (I still need to pay for private insurance but not nearly as much). That said I use much of my vacation just to visit my family/friends back in the US. If you are in your late twenties like me, you\u2019ll have to contend with missing weddings/bachelor parties/US trips with friends. Flying across the Atlantic for a quick trip really sucks ($$$, time, jet lag). But your friends/family will want to visit you too. It evens out a bit. \n\nAgain, I\u2019m doing it and have a really nice life, but at least once a week I think about how much I miss my friends and could be earning 2-3x with the same job in the US. \n\nIf/when I come back to the US I\u2019ll have great intangible life experience, a nice european social circle, lots of bucket list checks, and proficiency in the Spanish language. In the short run will not be able to catch up financially with those who never left, to me that isn\u2019t as important though. \n\nIt\u2019s one thing to daydream about doing it during a slow day at the office and another to follow through with it. Unless you\u2019re lucky it\u2019s not simple \u2014 but it is very rewarding if you\u2019re looking for a major life shake up.",
            "I'm an American Expat now living in Amsterdam working as an MLE (but my role also overlaps with DS because I know more statistics and modeling than any of the other data people). I'd say my pay here is about 70-80% of the US but as others have pointed out you make a lot of that up with competent social services and not living in a car dependant city. Housing in Amsterdam is quite expensive but still cheaper than the bay area. The biggest difference in work culture is there isn't this expectation of being always online, taking your work home, or working yourself to death. I don't feel the need to be constantly monitoring my phone and I get a ton of vacation days per year. The work culture is more chill for sure.\n\nAmsterdam is nice because the Netherlands has the highest English fluency mainland Europe. My company is 50% Dutch and 50% people from all over the world. My onboarding team was 2 French, 1 Turkish, 1 Albanian, and a Brit. My direct coworker are from Spain, Belgium, Argentina, India, Russia, and the rest are Dutch. I love the international feel and the diversity, but as one might expect, the company is still very \"European.\" \n\nOne of the big pluses of the Netherlands is the 30% rule. Basically, if you qualify you can get the first 30% of your income untaxed, which in the Netherlands is huge as the taxes here are quite high. You can get the 30% rule for up to 5 years, after which you need to pay taxes as usual. But I'll almost certainly stay after the 30% rule is over because living here is amazing. I bike to work every day though a beautiful city and the people here are kind and open. I've lived in Seattle, San Francisco, and other parts of Europe but Amsterdam is my favorite for sure. \n\nFinding housing is a huge challenge and doing it remotely is next to impossible. But once you clear that hurdle getting setup here is easier than most international cities.",
            "I\u2019m an American working in the UK. It was great until I got laid off while on a work visa. If you come to the UK, come on a global talent visa \u2014 I\u2019m applying for it right now and fingers crossed that I get it, but I\u2019m not exaggerating when I say this is the single most stressful thing that\u2019s ever happened to me. \n\nAlso, you will take a massive pay cut, there\u2019s no two ways about it. You might think it\u2019s worth it, and I was very happy with my pay, but some of the companies I\u2019m interviewing with are paying in the \u00a360s for senior level data science (and I\u2019m desperate enough to take a huge pay cut due to the work visa situation). Even my very well paid senior level job topped out at 100k all in (including stock).\n\nFinally, don\u2019t underestimate the difficulty of leaving a life that you\u2019ve built abroad. I too thought that I would just be in Europe for a year, maybe 2, but once you starting building a life especially when you\u2019re in your mid to late 20s or early 30s, when you\u2019re meeting your life partner, thinking about settling down, etc., it\u2019s hard to leave that. I would 10000% recommend working abroad and the pay cut is definitely worth it for a few years, but you might find yourself in a situation where it\u2019s pick between much lower pay and a life you\u2019ve built and much higher pay and a return back to the USA that you\u2019re not sure you want (my current situation). I would still do it all again, just a word of warning.",

            "I live and work in Helsinki and I wouldn't change it for the world.  I took a 40% pay cut on paper, but my real pay cut was more like 10%.  That's because I don't need to pay car payment, car insurance, retirement, kid's school tuition, health insurance, etc.  After 2 years, my salary was higher than when I worked in the US. Quality of life is unimaginably higher than in the US.\n\nFinding a job was hard, but if you actually commit to learning the local job culture, it becomes easy.  I spent about 4 months in virtual coffees and whatnot just learning the job culture.  Once I did that, I got a job in 2 months.  I pay $0/year in American taxes because I don't make any American money.  You only continue to pay American taxes if you continue to make American Money."

He doesn't care if it's a complicated LSTM or a basic SARIMA, Regression with lags or even a smoothing technique that gets the job done. \n\nThis is for most DS roles unless you are talking about Research Scientists/MLEs whose main goal is to extract something specific from a recently published paper and use that in their models and be more upto date. Sure, that's great. Personally, I feel these folks lack business context and that's their tradeoff for being more complex/technical. Of course these folks get paid more as well due to the value attached to that skill set.",

            "In my opinion, and from what I've seen from my job search the last few months, there are (very roughly) speaking two kinds of data science positions on the market (if you exclude those that are clearly data engineer/ML engineer/data analyst, but named as data scientist). They don't have good names from what I've heard, but let's call them 'theoretical DS' and 'practical DS'.  \n\n\nThe theoretical DS is leaning more towards ML engineering. They keep up-to-date on the latest developments within the field, make complex models that solve business problems, etc., but they have limited amounts of stakeholder management and domain expertise. They are usually depth-first - they have a general overview of the DS field, but are specialized within computer vision, NLP, etc.  \n\n\nThe practical DS is leaning more towards Data analyst. Often called product data scientists, they are usually more generalist and spend more time with stakeholders, understanding the domain, and communicating the results of models. Here, the model they end up using is much less important than which problem they are solving. Contrary to the theoretical DS, it's not really clear which problem should be solved, or how it should be solved. While the theoretical DS knows they have to make a recommender system, and the difficulty is in how to tune it and make it extremely good, the practical DS requires more collaboration with PMs and others to figure out what to do.  \n\n\nThe days of data scientists being in positions requiring the latter but doing the former are (mostly) over, because a lot of companies have realized that a fancy neural network doesn't necessarily equal an impact on the bottom line.  \n\n\nAll that is to say, don't feel bad at all! Rather, spend more time talking with stakeholders, cleaning data, exploring data, because that's usually what makes an impact in industry.",

Our models, like a random forest for example, often suss out a variety of non-linear relationships.

We've built up a whole library for representing chemical structures and chemical complexes with their own class methods, attributes, etc.  A lot revolves around inheritance.  Similarly, when building ML models, we reuse a lot of the same infrastructure, which has been abstracted into OOP.",
            "Basically anytime you expect to have generic repeatable logic that can be used across projects and there isn\u2019t any existing Python library for you to use, you should build out custom functions, custom classes or if necessary your own custom packages. Common cleaning functions or something domain specific that needs to be captured to add agility to future projects are good justifications for this type of thing. \n\nAt my work, we\u2019ve written custom classes for PySpark code to help simplify our data pipelines on Azure. Some steps that leverage Microsoft\u2019s SDK are used across projects so tying these things together really makes a world of difference for our team. For example, mssparkutils is called when we\u2019re accessing various data lake containers but this initial setup step applies every time we\u2019re reading data, so there\u2019s no reason to rewrite that code across projects. Instead, we\u2019ve written code to handle this process against any of our data lake\u2019s containers.",
            "They\u2019re particularly good for encapsulation. When constructed correctly, you can hide a tremendous amount of complexity behind a simple set of methods and trust it to maintain its own crud internally without you babysitting the logic. That in turn lets you code from the perspective of, \u201cI don\u2019t care how it does the job as long as it\u2019s doing the job it says it does.\u201d\n\nAs an example, suppose you have a purely functional-style implementation of a pseudorandom number generator, no OOP whatsoever. Your PRNG necessarily has an initial state and some parameters to determine its next state. In a purely functional implementation, you\u2019d then have gen_next_double(state, params) as your function for getting the next result. But\u2026 in order for it to work correctly, gen_next_double() would also need to return the next state. So you\u2019d have to code it as \u201cr_val, next_state = gen_next_double(curr_state, params)\u201d. And every single time you called that function, you\u2019d have to make sure you correctly passed in the previous state lest you repeat a subsequence and undermine the pseudorandomness. That\u2019s a lot of work just to grab a random number, and you\u2019d almost certainly make a mistake if your code was even the least bit technical. May god have mercy on your soul if you\u2019ve never worked with PRNG states before, and you\u2019d better not need parallelism.\n\nEnter OOP. Define a RandomNumberGenerator class with attributes curr_state and params. Then you can give it a method .gen_next_double() that knows to grab curr_state and params; and then automatically updates curr_state at the end. Then all you have to do is provide an initial state and the params one singular time, and let the class handle all the bookkeeping for you. If someone comes along who doesn\u2019t know a thing about state machines, that\u2019s okay. The class handles it for them, so they don\u2019t have to worry about repeated sequences and such because the class handles that internally.",

            "Classes are useful to wrap a bunch of data that is being passed between functions or modules. Without classes, you end up passing around arrays, tuples or dictionaries. When complexity increases things get messy and hard to debug. If you abstract the data into classes, for example \"sample\", \"processed_sample\", \"prediction\", \"aggragated_data\", where each class is documented, has well named attributes, getters, setters, debug functions (any form on introspection), arguments validation; it's much easier to scale up the complexity. The classed themselves don't have to be complicated, you can use python built in `dataclass`; but even thin wrappers around dictionaries with some minimal logic can turn out to be very useful. \n\nThis was about data abstraction. Of course, others have mentioned logic abstraction into classes, inheritance, instances, etc. \n\nFinally, I want to answer a more general questions: \"should I use feature X in the field of Y?\". The short answer: it's always a good thing to increase the breadth of your knowledge. New ideas and innovation often arise when new tools are being used to solve old problems. Python is currently the main language in DS and ML. It is definitely worth your time to improve your proficiency with it, learn new ways of using it, even if you currently not sure how to apply *classes* to what you're working on **now**."

Initially, I thought the barrier was a lack of vision among decision-makers, but as I climbed the corporate ladder, I discovered the real challenge was not just creating groundbreaking projects, but ensuring their adoption within the company. Despite becoming proficient at the art of selling ideas and achieving some significant successes, the demands of management now consume all my time. I find myself mired in meetings, one-on-ones, and endless slide decks, leaving no space for the very innovation I sought to promote. This paradox highlighted a crucial lesson: having the power to initiate change doesn't guarantee the capacity to execute it, especially in a field where the talent for both data science and leadership is rare. The question then becomes: how do you find the balance?\n\nEdit: To clarify, I do not feel the need to code or even solve develop the solution my self. I just want to be part of the internal innovation process and not be stuck maintaining a custom product a consultancy company got to build.",

            "If you thought becoming a manager would give you more time to work on innovative data science projects, you played yourself.\n\nThe fact that you describe yourself as \"mired\" in the things managers are supposed to do, is a good indication you're not happy. Maybe that's the environment, unproductive meetings make me unhappy too, but maybe it's that you'd be happier as a lead/principal DS? There's no shame in that, that work is very important and very lucrative too.\n\nI've been a manager and director of data teams for about 10 years now, and I love it. The greatest joy in my job is when my team are stuck on something and I can say the right thing to the right people, write the right memo, deliver the right presentation to get them moving. If that and the people management stuff doesn't make you happy, perhaps it's not for you?",
            "As a manager, your job should be all about empowerment not really balance. You shouldn't need to be the smartest person in the room, you should just be hiring them. Then you should be cultivating them and setting them on a path to success even if that means growing beyond your team and company. Sure, it can be beneficial to the company to be able to jump in the race and help a fellow team member cross the finish line. However, a good manager can also find the right resources to help that team member cross if they cannot run themselves too.\n\nI manage this way and when I switched to this approach, I have had most of my team come back to me after they left and tell me that without me, they wouldn't be where they are today. That's how I knew I was doing my job right as manager and it had nothing to do with me trying to balance the skills to do their job.",
            "Management is about delivering through others, not delivering yourself. You are there to empower your reports, not be one. If you don't have the ability to do their job, you won't have credibility, but your purpose is first to enable them to do it to the best of their ability and second to improve that ability to the greatest possible extent. If you want to buy in to the system of exploitation, another function of management is to maximise the amount of work that you're getting out of your reports too, but I find that one to be much better when viewed as a consequence of empowerment and innovation rather than a primary aim.\n\n\n\nLeadership is about being the reason those you're delivering through want to do it. Anyone at any level can practice it, it's not a management skill.\n\n\nAs you progressed up you probably should have been (made?) aware that management isn't about IC, there's a good reason the two tracks are distinct in sufficiently large organisations",
            "There's some truth to this, although I wouldn't paint as bleak a picture. My favorite parts were always research design and the final write-ups, so not doing the data prep work is awesome. I also get to teach team members when they're struggling with something.\n\nIt's rare to simultaneously excel as a data scientist and as a manager because they're very different skill sets. When it comes to data skills, you either \"use it or lose it.\" My technical skills have definitely atrophied since I became a director of a data science department, although I could probably get myself back up to speed in a few weeks or maybe months if I had to become an individual contributor again. \n\nBut I spend about 30% of my hours in meetings and another 20% just on emails. Team management takes up another 10-20%, depending on the week. So really only 30-40% of my time is spent on contributing to deliverables, some of which are more strategic planning than actual reports. \n\nAnyway, you find the balance by striving to be a great manager while remaining a competent data scientist. Those who try to be competent managers while great scientists generally don't stay in a managerial role for long.",

Maybe I have PTSD from having been a Java programmer before for ages, but I find the excessive use of classes for code structuring actually harder to maintain than just simply organizing the codes with functions, especially for data pipelines (where the input is a set of dataframes and the output is also a set of dataframes).\n\nP.S. I wanted to keep my example short, so I haven't shown more smaller functions inside calculate_delta(). But the emphasis is not that they would wrap 1 single function in a class; but that they wrap a set of functions in a class without any further reasons (the wrapper class is not re-used, there is no internal state to maintain etc.). So the full app could be organized with pure functions, they just wrap the functions in \"Processor\" and \"Orchestrator\" classes, using one time classes for code organization.",

If you can do it with functions, there's no point in introducing complexity just because you want to define classes.\n\nPersonally, I deal with Pytorch so I often have model classes and custom datasets inheriting from their Pytorch analogous classes. Also use objects if a pipeline requires instantiating another object because, if loading it takes a while, it makes sense to persist it rather than creating it every time it is needed. Basically, use objects when it makes sense to model a state with one and when you need to persist complex data structures. Otherwise, just call a bunch of functions and dump the output in a file.",

            "I've been in a \\_similar\\_ position to you as before. Here's my thought process; I hope it helps!\n\n\\> Currently work as a Data Science Tech Lead in an Insurance AI lab with 20+ data scientist. Overlooking 3 squads, coaching senior DS & maintaining technical quality. The lab mainly do NLP research & projects are interesting.\n\nThat's awesome! Definitely make sure you give yourself some credit for being able to push yourself to grow, learn new skills, and take on more ownership & responsibility. It's hard to do and doesn't come easy for most people.\n\n\\> The higher the career ladder, the fewer chance for me to actually write code & touch the data\n\nThere's many ways to think about this:\n\n1. Is it possible that you miss writing code and touching the data **because you're really really good at it?** We like doing things that we're really good at! This explains why the average chess player or esports video game player never becomes pro. They found their passion playing matches in their comfort zone, but they dislike doing deliberate practice on their weaknesses because it's uncomfortable.\n2. Is it possible that once you become just as competent and comfortable being a leader, **that you would enjoy it just as much**? The characteristics of being an IC vs a leader are very different, absolutely. For the most part, you can forget about deep work and spending weeks reading papers. But leading teams is also very fulfilling in it's own way.\n3. In some sense, \"moving up the chain of command\" by definition means that you aren't a grunt in the army anymore firing weapons but instead leading and helping the infantry make the right decisions. If the details are **down** in the weeds, then you are **up** above scouring the map. Your former in-the-weeds knowledge is still important because that's how you build trust with the folks in the weeds. No engineer likes reporting to someone who never coded (or who at least doesn't respect engineers).\n\n\\> Data Scientist is never (really) the bread & butter of a company. Yes we can build ML model that generate business value, but rarely the core business.\n\nIn most companies, this rings true. If you want to play with math and algorithms, then your best bet is to work in an academic or industry lab. That's a different set of tradeoffs of course.\n\nAnalytics, aka counting stuff reliably for a business, can be incredibly rewarding if you have the right mindset and outlook. If reading fun ML papers is the main goal, then there's maybe only a few hundred roles in industry where you really get to do this and those are competitive. And as you pointed out, ML plays a small role in business in general.\n\n\\> That also means up to certain level, the only way up is to manage people & focus on the business side.\n\nThis doesn't align with my own experience. There are many ways to add value to the world here:\n\n1. You could help companies build their data science strategy as a consultant. You have to work with stakeholders but may not have to manage a large team of people.\n2. You could create educational content on how teams should think about data science and ML.\n3. You could build your own product where DS / ML are at the core. Lean on your hybrid IC and management background\n\n\\> The coming trend of LLM is worrying too (for all DS working in NLP)\n\nMeh. LLM's are neat for sure. But just like Google search empowered everyone to be more productive, so will LLM's. Nearly every time X technology is supposed to replace / reduce the need for Y skill / job, **it never pans out that way because you can't predict in advance how the structure of the work and the organization will change**.\n\nA simple example -- Instagram was acquired for $1 billion by Facebook and had a team of less than 20 people. If you wanted to build Instagram in 2001 or 2005, you would have needed thousands of people. You would have had to make mobile data work, build your own phone, mobile phone operating system, and so much more. Apple, the cell phone providers, and thousands of companies \"automated\" / replaced the need for every company to tackle every single part of the problem in-house. Similarly, AWS didn't eliminate the need for DevOps engineers / SysAdmins, it created a world where even small teams can punch above their weight class.\n\nLLM's will help thousands of smaller teams get more done and punch above their weight class. Just like Google Search meant that every employee in a company didn't have to ask an assistant to go down to the library to look up \"the names of Abraham Lincoln's kids\"\n\n**Lastly -- I will end with some links that informed my outlook on work.**\n\n\\- So Good They Can't Ignore You by Cal Newport: [https](https://commoncog.com/so-good-they-cant-ignore-you/)\n\n[://commoncog.com/so-good-they-cant-ignore-you/](https://commoncog.com/so-good-they-cant-ignore-you/)\n\n\\- Extreme Ownership by Jocko Willink: [https://www.amazon.com/Extreme-Ownership-U-S-Navy-SEALs/dp/1250067057](https://www.amazon.com/Extreme-Ownership-U-S-Navy-SEALs/dp/1250067057)\n\n\\- LNO framework by Shreyas Doshi: [https://www.dualoop.com/blog/shreyas-doshi-the-lno-effectiveness-framework](https://www.dualoop.com/blog/shreyas-doshi-the-lno-effectiveness-framework)\n\n&#x200B;\n\nMy personal TL;DR:\n\n\\- Work is hard. If you want to get paid well, you have to do things that most people don't want to do. Everyone loves analyzing data and reading ML papers. Very few people know how to / want to figure out how to build ML products that add value to humans. Do you want to just feel good and stay comfortable, or work on challenging things that reward you? Everyone has a spot on the spectrum they're comfortable with\n\n\\- Discomfort is how you grow. If you hate managing teams, figure out how to get leadership training, mentorship, feedback, and become so good at leadership that you start to enjoy it and it becomes part of your identity.\n\n\\- Extreme ownership -- take ownership of the problems in your team or organization. Not everything is your fault, but if you take ownership, people will give you more responsibility and you will build massive amounts of trust. Use that trust to get buy-in for high-risk projects you're personally passionate about (someone I know cashed in their internal trust to spend 1 day a week reading reinforcement learning papers and teaching the rest of the team). You don't get that on day 1 though.\n\n\\- Focus & prioritize the wildly important things at work. What types of activities will get you promoted? Which ones will get you fired? Which ones do you just need to do a \"good enough\" job at? Nobody got promoted because they planned their coworkers' birthday celebrations at work.",

            "For many of us, a PhD means you are doing \u201cdata science\u201d with projects that result in a level of quality that they can be published in reputable peer reviewed journals and are heavily scrutinized. That\u2019s basically a higher bar than any other self taught DS project.",
            "\u201cEasy\u201d feels like a big underselling of how much work gets into finishing a Ph.D.\n\nIt depends a bit on the topic and what you actually did, but essentially, you can see it with layers:\n\n* Any Ph.D. is actually several years of work experience that candidates are keen to talk about: it\u2019s a lot easier to interview people with experience as you can ask behavioral questions (How did you react when you were confronted to\u2026), especially painful ones: it\u2019s socially OK to assume that a Ph.D. advisor is the worse possible boss, and candidate don\u2019t assume, as the recruiting manager one is comparing themselves to them;\n* Any Ph.D. is a very narrow, technical topic. It is, again, expected to ask a candidate what this was about\u2014another easy way to ask one of the most relevant but hard-to-ask questions for analytical profiles: \u201cExplain to me something that I\u2019m not familiar with, and make sure to make it clear, engaging and to highlight the value of your own work.\u201d The interview hasn\u2019t started, and I already have asked and gotten answers to my two key behavioral questions.\n* Any Ph.D. is a long, tedious, frustrating experience\u2014always. There are some exceptions (very well-managed, tightly controlled labs where doctorands are followed up close and told what to do in detail). Still, in general, the two previous questions open the conversation to the third most important quality when dealing with all forms of nastiness (corporate bullcrap, Python dependency hell, bad data quality, model refusing to converge): grit. The ability to shake off the lack of progress and go back to that nasty email, pulling your hair over inconsistent data, and going one more page further while googling that confusing error message is key for so many projects. Knowing you've done it and you ended up victorious is very precious. And I don\u2019t even need to ask any questions to know that. That\u2019s your:\n\n>guarantees that the candidate can work independently as well as in a team and can conduct research and analysis. \n\n&#x200B;\n\n* Many Ph.D.s notably in STEM, but not exclusively involve extensive data analysis\u2014using R, Python, or an exotic tool. The same stack is good, but any experience dealing with code is helpful. There are a lot of people who write nasty, impossible-to-re-use scripts and have bad habits, but as your manager, I\u2019d much rather walk you through refactoring your code than teach you `pandas` from scratch. Give me a Ph.D. in astrophysics every day of the week: their code is unreadable, but they know the most confusing image-processing libraries. After that, no data format can scare them. Just tell them to refactor their code because it\u2019s nowhere *near* company standards, give them pointers to videos about general good coding practice or internal guidelines; do that five times in a row, and open their PR after the sixth submission.\n* For some Ph.D.s, although that\u2019s more a minority, you have pre-existing domain expertise. It\u2019s common for research in Machine Learning, but not exclusively: I\u2019ve hired people with a background in operation research (an old form of DS, more focused on logistics, elevator, and factory settings), game design, and applied mathematics. I know many people hired because of their research in economics, social and political science, and digital ethnography, too. That helps, but it\u2019s rarely the reason. When it is, it\u2019s kind of obvious: the company provided data for the research, the interview was a call with the advisor or a seminar part of the job market rotation. For many of those, people are hiring for familiarity with the domain over SOTA, but I know people who had to be at the top of their game to get the job. That would be this part of your explanation:\n\n>most DS jobs aren't actually SOTA research of the likes of Meta and Netflix (thus a PhD doesn't really add up much value to the equation)?\n\nTypically, when I interview, I recommend having a small number of questions with example graded answers (1 to 5, so \u201cCan they code?\u201c 1 is \u201cthey\u2019ve heard about it,\u201d and 5 is \u201cmaintains an open-source package used by thousands or core contributor to libraries used in production\u201d). It\u2019s not always easy to have convincing examples to say: \u201dFor that question, here\u2018s why I think that candidate is a 4.\u201d\n\nInterviewing Ph.D.s typically allows me to have clear answers to 4 or 5 out of the seven of eight questions that I have within five minutes. It doesn\u2019t mean that they\u2019ll get the job, but I\u2019m more confident in my decision. Being arrogant is a common reason to fail people, for instance, and if you say that I won\u2019t understand when I ask what your research was about\u2026",
            "There is nothing guaranteed about a PhD. The PhD itself is not guaranteed once you start the program.\n\nHowever, if you do have a PhD, you'd fall under the \"preferred\" category for job applicants at large companies, specially for those data science roles that focus on experimentation or other niche ML domains. That is not to say that a PhD makes it an easy pass, but it means that if 2 final applicants performed equally well in the interview process, the company will choose the one with a PhD first.",

            "First, ensure that the DBA **changes the high-importance alert email and contact details to yours**.\n\n**Then the most important part is backup**. The idea being that if someone or something burns down the data center, your company should be able to recover its data from someplace - typically geographically separated by a few kms/miles, assuming a small company.\n\nBackups are of 2 types: (1) Full backup = entire DB is backed up - maybe once a week or month (2) Incremental backup - which can be once or twice daily, and captures only the changes since the last full or incremental backup.\n\nIn the worst case, take a daily / weekly data dump (full or incremental) on an external hard drive and store it someplace, or even on a separate laptop that you take from the company.\n\nNext is to find some DBA who can be called upon in an emergency - even if at inflated rates. One example: The data gets corrupted. Uncorrupting data is somewhat like restoring your laptop to a previous version of windows because this one is messed up - it's not easy to do, and generally, you WILL lose some data, and you will not be able to learn it in a few days.\n\nNow above 2 are important, but once in a while kinda scenarios.\n\nOn a day-to-day basis, DB performance is going to be the occasional headache. For this you need to see where to look in the Database Management System - typically this will be a ready made dashboard that you glance at now & then to ensure things are fine.\n\nGoing forward, this dashboard will become your lifeblood - should have all key indicators like when was the data last backed up, etc.\n\nThen there are daily troubles - like some DB tables responding slow to queries, DB space getting filled up, people wanting to push-in new apps or changes that might mess up the DB performance, etc. These you will have to initially approach on a person-by-person basis: who is real and who are dumb fucks and who are good but do weird things.\n\nAs a DBA you have to do some periodic stuff based on indicators given by the DBMS - like reorganize data (kinda like defrag in windows), regenerate statistics (like 'refresh the metadata'), but none of these are urgent.\n\nSQL isn't difficult to learn; don't worry about it too much. Just do it on the side.\n\nI am not a DBA, but have done fair bit of s/w in life, so I do know some DBMS stuff.\n\nEdit: Forgot a major deal: Chances are high that there will be some who will want you to put data in the DB directly rather than via the proper route through an app or website, because the app/site is malfunctioning. Be very careful of such cases - the emergency can be real, but it's very difficult to tell if the resulting update or insert will mess things up. And don't allow anyone to delete data, ever - unless they come thru 2 or 3 levels above you.",

As you can imagine, this makes jumping from analyst to data scientist very difficult despite being qualified (MS stats, 7 years in various, increasingly senior analyst roles). Where are these roles?",
        "comments": [
            "The level of business understanding required for a lot of data science work kinda makes junior data scientist a difficult role to create. Someone with a few years of experience in an analyst role who has cursory experience building ML models is probably going to be more successful in a \u201cstandard\u201d data scientist role than a recent college grad who\u2019s handy with ML but has very little experience in general.\u00a0",
            "Can I say something controversial?\n\nData Science is not a junior level job.  I know data science means a lot of different things depending on where you work, but generally it involves applying the scientific method + domain knowledge + taking into account business context.  Enough domain knowledge to make meaningful product recommendations is itself probably not something a junior candidate has, let alone good scientific skills (here, I'm not considering fitting models a scientific skill).\n\nAnalyst type jobs are the _de facto_  junior level IMHO, since this is where you're going to cut your teeth on core technologies and sharpen your domain expertise, and in all likelihood develop good scientific practices.\n\nEDIT:  Addressing OP's question more directly\n\nTech -- where the majority of DS roles are -- is in a turbulent time right now. Data science is not a core need for a business like software engineering, so there are fewer \"Data Scientist\" roles (setting aside Senior for a moment).\n\nWhen those roles are being hired for (and they are being hired for, I'm just not sure where you are looking), the roles are senior level (e.g. Senior DS, staff DS) because senior people have a better chance of being independent and not needing extensive hand holding. Because of my first point, companies currently can't afford to train junior people up, so they are hiring for reliable senior talent.\n\nThe roles exist, or at least have existed in the past, but market conditions are currently forcing orgs to reconsider who they hire and for what.",
            "I agree with others that data science doesn\u2019t have much room for junior roles. Usually only see junior DS at bigger / data-focused companies that have a business case for training up DS (massive tech company or very specialized domain w need to upskill talent). scientist very similar to senior analyst\u2014 unfortunately it means there aren\u2019t many junior DS roles BUT fortunately, it means there is a clear (ish) path from analyst to DS. I would encourage you to look for an analyst role that involves doing some DS type of stuff, at a company you like, with room for advancement, establish yourself and then make the case for a transition to DS once you\u2019ve proven your value. If you land an analyst role and convince your employer to give you a DS title, you\u2019ve essentially \u201cmade it\u201d and are forever after a data scientist, and in my experience this is so much easier than finding a DS role from scratch\u00a0",
            "I don\u2019t think junior level data science ever really existed at mass scale. It inherently is a profession that requires deep math/stats knowledge, strong software engineering skills, project management skills, and domain knowledge. All that is needed to simply land impact.\n\nMany who are currently senior/staff/principal in the field never started in junior DS roles, but instead they joined a mid-level role after PhD or transitioned into mid-level roles from software engineering or quant/statistician roles.\n\nWhat is new in the current time is that hordes of universities have started churning out master degrees in data science who are now looking for junior DS roles that don\u2019t exist and never existed in the first place. \n\nI have been warning for years against DS master programs and advocating instead for statistics master or PhD programs that give a stronger mathematical foundation. I have always seen the current scenario as a likely scenario, which is now playing out.",
            "Yeah, because the junior jobs are saturated. It takes a really long time for someone to become a good Data Scientist and even longer for someone to be able to create direction. Most companies are bottom heavy in these roles so the high level ones are the ones that are available."

        "content": "We're in the midst of the AI revolution, where groundbreaking language models are released almost every week, captivating our imagination. But as we marvel at these impressive models, do we truly understand the technology that powers and stores them? Enter vector databases \u2013 the hidden powerhouse behind the scenes. In this article, we'll embark on a journey to demystify vector databases, unravelling the fundamental concepts, applications, and their indispensable role in supporting and harnessing the potential of cutting-edge AI models.\n\nIn the world of AI, large language models heavily rely on vector embeddings, which are representations of data that carry semantic information. These embeddings have numerous attributes or features, making them complex to manage. In simple terms, the process of converting raw data into vectors is crucial to preserve information and relationships. To achieve this, we employ an embedding model that takes the raw data as input and generates vector embeddings. By passing the raw data through the embedding model, we ensure that the resulting vector embeddings retain significant information and capture the underlying relationships present in the data. This conversion enables efficient processing, analysis, and comparisons of the data in a more compact and meaningful vector representation.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n[Vector Embedding Process](https://preview.redd.it/5hufgl68z38b1.png?width=755&format=png&auto=webp&s=dc0518393865f472b63a3d3943a4cd1c64d1f2a7)\n\nTraditional databases struggle to handle the scale and complexity of this data, hindering real-time analysis and insights. That's where vector databases come in.\n\nVector databases are designed specifically to handle vector embeddings, offering performance, scalability, and flexibility. They enable advanced features like semantic information retrieval and long-term memory for AI models. Here's how they work:\n\n1. Generating Embeddings: An embedding model creates vector embeddings for the content we want to index, capturing essential patterns and relationships.\n2. Inserting into the Database: The vector embeddings are inserted into the vector database, along with references to the original content they were created from.\n3. Querying the Database: When an application issues a query, the same embedding model generates embeddings for the query. These query embeddings are used to search the vector database for similar vector embeddings.\n4. Retrieving Associated Content: The vector database returns similar embeddings along with the associated original content.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n[Vector Database Workflow](https://preview.redd.it/8eex0vfcz38b1.png?width=1399&format=png&auto=webp&s=243b1b98602e318fa1cab87ca8376366630d0af2)\n\n**How does a vector database work?**\n\nUnlike traditional databases that match exact values, vector databases use similarity metrics to find the most similar vectors to a query. They employ algorithms like Approximate Nearest Neighbor (ANN) search, optimizing search through techniques like hashing, quantization, or graph-based search.\n\nA typical vector database pipeline includes:\n\n1. Indexing: Vectors are indexed using algorithms like PQ, LSH, or HNSW, mapping them to a data structure for faster searching.\n2. Querying: The vector database compares the indexed query vector with the indexed vectors in the dataset to find the nearest neighbours based on similarity.\n3. Post Processing: In some cases, the vector database retrieves the nearest neighbours from the dataset and applies additional processing, such as re-ranking using a different similarity measure, to provide the final results.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n[Vector Database Pipeline](https://preview.redd.it/9lbwserez38b1.png?width=1307&format=png&auto=webp&s=889509816be32a36f89dee9560abae5ea5d8d883)\n\nBy employing these techniques, vector databases offer fast and accurate retrieval, striking a balance between speed and accuracy.\n\nIn summary, vector databases are tailored for managing vector embeddings, enabling efficient storage, retrieval, and analysis of complex AI data. Their unique capabilities play a vital role in powering advanced AI applications and unlocking the true potential of AI models.",

            "Good summary.\n\n\nI'm interested if anyone here has any experiences to share with the different vendors.\n\nFor now I'm managing our vector embeddings simply via numpy arrays and a cloud bucket. (I wrote a few python classes to do embedding vector upsert and lookup using numpy arrays that export to either text or parquet Files) but this is already running into problems as we're massively scaling up the number of documents we're embedding.\n\nI've been looking into Pinecone, Qdrant, Milvus and Weaviate as possible replacements but what they offer seems so similar it's hard to judge which one would be the best replacement. (I've also looked into just using the Google Matching Engine Approximate Nearest Neighbour search but the cost seems about the same as using an actual vector database so I don't see why I should go for just the ANN service instead).",

Seems like a different thing, and it's kind of irrelevant. Someone has already decided to read the article, so they think it's worth knowing. You don't need to persuade them.\n\n\"Today, massive data is gathered through automations and systems every day, making time-series data increasingly prevalent and accessible.\"  I don't know what automatons and systems are. Again, this is known. What about something like \"Organizations collect large amounts of data on a daily basis, which can be mined for insights and information.\"\n\n\"Consequently, the ability to learn from these time-series data and generate accurate forecasts for the future is becoming ever more essential.\" I don't see how that follows (is consequent). It's more essential? Essential is binary - it's essential or it's not. Maybe it's more useful, but why is it more useful than it would have been in the past? Presumably it's equally useful? But now we can do it? \n\nThe article is taking too long to get to the point. \n\nI encourage you to keep writing. Pretty much the only way to get better at writing is to do more of it. There are lots of ways to practice writing (and perhaps gain a reputation, which might be useful, or you can point people towards).  Blogs, Reddit, CrossValidated, etc can all be good practice and sources of feedback - try writing something wrong on CrossValidated and see what happens. :)",

Maybe make it shorter but to the point or split in two pieces.",
            "Don't feel bad. I use to write for TDS (30+ published articles) and the new chief editor is awful (he has no technical background and even worse is very arrogant). That said as others point out your article does have several run-on sentences, is hard to follow at times, and repeats itself. It also has a bit too much business jargon for my liking. If you want to DM me I could give more detailed feedback.\n\nI would honestly avoid publishing to TDS though and I say that as a prior author. They have gone down a road of pure clickbait and seem to now reject higher quality pieces they think might be too technical for their audience. It used to be they would just accept everything but now there is a lot more curation, however it is curation of clickbait.",
            "To be honest, I find the quote from their rejection quite spot on. You have a couple of introductory paragraphs, but they don't really get to the point and seem quite generic. From this generic intro, you jump into feature engineering without making clear what those features are and why it is necessary.\n\nYou eventually talk about accuracy, but don't really prove in any way that your assertion that tree models are better is true.\n\nThere are two images in the article. One is a very high level illustration of boosting, the other a very generic plot of feature importance. Neither of them illustrates an important argument in your text.\n\nOn the other hand, even though your whole article is about time series data and predictions from specific models, you never once show actual data, and you never once explicitly say what you want your model to do. Illustrations are your most important tool, use them!\n\nSo what I would suggest is:\n- start with your main statement that you want to bring accross\n- write down max three good arguments for it\n- find an illustration for each, add the illustration and describe how this illustration proves your point\n- Choose one or two examples of actual use cases and make it clear what you expect from your model (siderant: I'm not an ML guy first, and I care much less about the models than I do about the outcome. So for me it is much more important to learn what question we need to answer and how we define the quality of our answer, than what nice model we use)\n- This should give you an outline of your post, and you should be able to start writing along this.\n\nThere are probably general guidelines for writing to help you find a good style and so on, but I leave that to the native speakers with experience in writing.\n\nSorry if this comes off as critical but I hope this comment can help you and contains something useful.",

The recent example from Amazon's senior leadership really got me boiling, and I just had to get this off my chest.\n\nAs a data science practitioner myself\u2026 it's disheartening to see executives in both my field and beyond often using data points to validate their existing beliefs rather than *truly* utilizing data to guide their decisions. The cornerstone of our work is to analyze and interpret data objectively to uncover insights that inform strategic choices. Yet, time and again, we witness decisions driven by personal preferences and opinions rather than evidence.\n\nAmazon has long been regarded as a paragon of data-driven decision-making, and rightly so. The company has access to vast amounts of data and has used it effectively to shape their strategies and operations, such as Dynamic Pricing, Warehouse Optimization, and Fraud Detection. However, when I read about Mike Hopkins' statements regarding the return to office, I was shocked at the blatant disregard for fundamental data-driven principles.\n\nLet's break this down\u2026 Hopkins, a senior vice president of Prime Video and Amazon Studios, made a bold statement in an internal meeting, stating that it's time to return to the office without providing *any* substantial data to back up his claim. He says, \"I don't have data to back it up, but I know it's better.\"\n\nThe essence of data-driven decision-making lies in using objective data to support or reject a belief or hypothesis. By admitting that he lacks the data to back up his position, Hopkins is essentially admitting that he's making an uninformed decision, and worse yet, he's trying to influence others to follow suit blindly.\n\nWhat's even more infuriating is that this kind of behavior is not *that* uncommon among senior management, even in my own personal experience. Many of them already have preconceived notions or personal preferences, and they cherry-pick data points to support their beliefs while conveniently ignoring any data that contradicts them. The complete opposite of what Data Science is meant to achieve.\n\nData-driven decision-making is crucial, especially when it comes to complex matters like remote work. Many employees have adapted to working from home, and some even prefer it due to increased flexibility and work-life balance. Forcing a return to the office without concrete data to support the move is a clear sign of executive arrogance and a lack of respect for their employees' preferences and well-being.\n\nIt's hard to believe that a company as data-driven as Amazon wouldn't have data on the productivity and effectiveness of remote work\u2026 the company likely has access to a *trove* of information that could shed light on the effectiveness of remote work, including productivity metrics, employee satisfaction surveys, and more. It's puzzling why they would not utilize this data to inform their decisions, especially when the well-being and productivity of their workforce are at stake. Without clear and data-backed justifications, employees may feel undervalued and may question the credibility of leadership's intentions.\n\nAmazon's senior leadership should remember their commitment to data-driven principles and engage in transparent decision-making. If there are legitimate reasons to return to the office, they owe it to their employees to present the data and engage in an open discussion about the pros and cons. By withholding critical information, they are undermining trust and potentially making decisions that could hurt the company in the long run.\n\nAs a data science practitioner, I believe it's not just about having access to data; it's also about using it responsibly and ethically. Using data to back up preconceived beliefs, or worse, hiding data that counters those beliefs, undermines the credibility and ethics of data science as a field and the trust we place in data-driven decision-making.\n\nIn conclusion, the misuse and omission of data by executives is not only frustrating to witness but also detrimental to the progress of organizations. I find it incredibly disappointing that executives at Amazon, a company known for being data-driven, would advocate for a return to the office without any supporting data. As data scientists, we have a responsibility to advocate for the ethical and rigorous use of data, and as consumers and employees, we have the right to demand evidence-based decision-making from the companies we support.\n\nAm I alone in this? I'd love to hear the community\u2019s thoughts on this matter.\n\nTL;DR: Amazon's senior leadership's recent push for a return to office without any supporting data is a disappointment to their reputation as a data-driven company. Executives should practice what they preach and make decisions based on objective data rather than personal beliefs or preferences. This behavior is not only disrespectful to employees but also detrimental to the company's long-term success. When data takes a backseat it flies in the face of what Data Science is all about.  \n\n\nLink to article: [https://fortune.com/2023/08/03/amazon-svp-mike-hopkins-office-return/](https://fortune.com/2023/08/03/amazon-svp-mike-hopkins-office-return/)",

            ">Amazon has long been regarded as a paragon of data-driven decision-making, and rightly so.  \n\nAs long as the data is supporting generally held beliefs, otherwise it is not so much of data-driven at all. I've seen this at amazon way too many times, any piece of data that support consensus is totted as not needing further exploration and can be used as evidence, anything that depart from that is scrutinized in a way that makes beyond reasonable doubt like a joke. \n\nMy favorite thing to recall is when my coworker showed that X phenomenon is not true for all segments of the data, and there are a subset of customers (the top 10% high spenders) the trend is reversed (and it has very strong arguments why that is so). We spent an entire quarter of: **Okay last piece of evidence we requested confirms your point, but what about this other thing, did you check it out?**. The project ended up being having its directions shifted, and the irony of it, is that new approach which took half a year to finish also proved the earlier point. We are at 3 quarters in, when upper management finally acquiesced, we could have had 2 quarters advantage over other retailers, but we ended up being 1 quarter behind because an L8 was simply never satisfied. \n\n\n\nSuspicion is fine, but confirmation bias a big problem there.",
            "The Economist recently highlighted studies showing higher productivity in offices, but what I find frustrating about the RTO discussion, is that even when there\u2019s an attempt at a data driven discussion there\u2019s no nuance. \n\nThe studies themselves are extremely limited, looking at specific workers at a specific company. So maybe this makes sense at a startup where everyone can be in the same room, but at big companies, with offices spanning the country and the world, you\u2019re just commuting to take your Team\u2019s calls at the office. This was true even pre-Covid.",

            "I think there is still room for a jack-of-all-trades DS.  There are countless problems where deep learning is not the correct approach and some statistics or lighter-weight ML will do the trick.  However, in order to make your solutions available and live, they need to be deployed in an API, app, or static html page.  \n\nI think 5 years ago, a lot of DS had the mentality \"a developer will do that all for me and I'll just develop and hand over a Jupyter notebook.\"  You could get a job with that mentality for a few years.  But I don't think this worked out so well - most of those notebooks I saw in my company amounted to nothing, and some of those folks got laid off.  \n\nThe DS who understood some dev ops, Linux, databases, etc. were able to deploy solutions themselves or work more constructively with the developers to develop.  The job market may not be so hot for these guys anymore either, but I have to believe it will turn around for them because they'll have a compelling portfolio and route to value creation.",
            "People seem to forget that there is still no clear definition of DS/DA/MLE and it vary from place to place - it\u2019s important to be flexible because projects are not schematic and time is limited. I agree with both sentiments coming from this section. Firstly, if you only know how to code in notebooks with 0 OOP or at least clean functions and without minimal knowledge of APIs, databases (\u2026) then you won\u2019t be able to understand what happens with your \u201cprototype\u201d - there is a long road from model.fit() to actual production ready reusable tool. Secondly, machine learning is no cure for all business problems, a lot of problems can be explored using STAT101 or linreg/logit and where  you are at the level when problems suit heavy deep learning and marginal model performance affects crucial business processes at large scale then you spend at least weeks making sure that every bit of data and every mathematical operation that is applied makes sense. I know some graduate level math and graduate level CS and the more I learn the more I am concious about things that I don\u2019t know. IMO the strongest combo is the optimum between domain knowledge, theory and engineering skills. When the projects lacks one of these then you need to focus more on one aspect.",

Yes, good engineering, good system architecture, good software design is also important, but this is another profession (namely computer science), and honestly \u2013 it becomes more and more a commodity.

            "For what purpose?\n\nHere is the standard use case why Tableau and PowerBI have become household names:\n\nThe finance team has put together a dataset of customer-level financial data. They want to make dataset available both as a report, but also as a data source that other people across the organization can access. A lot of those people do not know how to operate a database, let alone write code that can pull that data from a database and then bring it into a dashboard-friendly environment.\n\nWhat they can do instead is publish that dataset, easily manage persmissions of who can access it (including row-level security), and then allow other teams to work with that dataset. It is *orders of magnitude easier* to learn how to use PowerBI/Tableau given a dataset that has already been created for you.\n\nStreamlit and Dash do not do that easily Streamlit and Dash are great for creating most custom dashboards for a smaller audience.\n\nAnd what Streamlit and Dash are actually spectucular for is building not dashboards, but apps - a quick application that doesn't just display information, but can run code in the background and then actually do something with user inputs (and resulting outputs). \n\nThis is like asking \"why do people still use nails when we already have screws?\".

            "Strong SE ability can massively boost your DS ability, both in terms of multiplying what you can do in data science, and in terms of productionization, so this part is something to be embraced IMO. Getting better at this also means you can knock out any boring dashboarding tasks you have to do really quickly and move on.\n\nIt seems like your problems actually come from the management side of thing, i.e. (1) your time is being wasted in lengthy standups and retros, and (2) your time is being wasted on fixing UIs and SE-only tasks (as opposed to mainly DS, and only SE tasks that boost your actual DS work). A lot of the time, PMs will not understand what data science is about and how to get the most out of data scientists, or even what's possible. To solve this problem, you need to think quite far outside the box.\n\nHere's my recommendation: Spend time figuring out what's possible and valuable in your org using the data they have, and your data science skills, and then convince the right people to make sure you actually get to work on it. Ultimately, if you get the PMs on board, they start working for you, not the other way round.",

Or, to put it another way, companies are realizing they can hire talented \"data analysts\" who are just as capable at 95% of the work \"data scientists\" were doing (but get paid a more reasonable salary for that work).\n\nMy advice: focus on an industry -- like finance or logistics -- or on a specific function -- like improving marketing or improving digital products. There are ML aspects to each of these, even if it's not pure ML.\n\nNowadays, showing up and saying, \"I'm really good at ML\" is like trying to get a construction job by saying, \"I'm really good at hammers.\" No construction contractor hires someone because they're \"good at hammers\". They hire people because they know how to frame a house or how to pour a foundation.\n\nOnce you figure out the industry/function you want to specialize in, don't worry as much about the title. Focus on getting really good at that thing and take whatever job helps you do that better.",

        "content": " Optimizing your neural network training with Batch Normalization \n\n[Visualizing What Batch Normalization Is and Its Advantages](https://preview.redd.it/dah6fe3kgigc1.png?width=999&format=png&auto=webp&s=a0f8a08ae05cf2989d109ae274b6f65e5cc83002)\n\n# Introduction\n\n Have you, when conducting deep learning projects, ever encountered a situation where the more layers your neural network has, the slower the training becomes? \n\n If your answer is YES, then congratulations, it's time for you to consider using batch normalization now. \n\n# What is Batch Normalization?\n\n As the name suggests, batch normalization is a technique where batched training data, after activation in the current layer and before moving to the next layer, is standardized. Here's how it works: \n\n1. *The entire dataset is randomly divided into N batches without replacement, each with a mini\\_batch size, for the training.*\n2. *For the i-th batch, standardize the data distribution within the batch using the formula:* *(Xi - Xmean) / Xstd**.*\n3. *Scale and shift the standardized data with* *\u03b3Xi + \u03b2* *to allow the neural network to undo the effects of standardization if needed.*\n\n The steps seem simple, don't they? So, what are the advantages of batch normalization? \n\n# Advantages of Batch Normalization\n\n### Speeds up model convergence\n\n Neural networks commonly adjust parameters using gradient descent. If the cost function is smooth and has only one lowest point, the parameters will converge quickly along the gradient. \n\n But if there's a significant variance in the data distribution across nodes, the cost function becomes less like a pit bottom and more like a valley, making the convergence of the gradient exceptionally slow. \n\n Confused? No worries, let's explain this situation with a visual: \n\n First, prepare a virtual dataset with only two features, where the distribution of features is vastly different, along with a target function: \n\n    rng = np.random.default_rng(42)\n    \n    A = rng.uniform(1, 10, 100)\n    B = rng.uniform(1, 200, 100)\n    \n    y = 2*A + 3*B + rng.normal(size=100) * 0.1  # with a little bias\n\n Then, with the help of GPT, we use matplot3d to visualize the gradient descent situation before data standardization: \n\n[ Visualization of cost functions without standardization of data.  ](https://preview.redd.it/s7zorqm9higc1.png?width=537&format=png&auto=webp&s=f92388f9e3384eee96ce2585b7bc70f25392cee9)\n\n Notice anything? Because one feature's span is too large, the function's gradient is stretched long in the direction of this feature, creating a valley. \n\n Now, for the gradient to reach the bottom of the cost function, it has to go through many more iterations. \n\n But what if we standardize the two features first? \n\n    def normalize(X):\n        mean = np.mean(X)\n        std = np.std(X)\n        return (X - mean)/std\n    \n    A = normalize(A)\n    B = normalize(B)\n\n Let's look at the cost function after data standardization: \n\n[ Visualization of standardized cost functions for data. ](https://preview.redd.it/5ou0awyehigc1.png?width=618&format=png&auto=webp&s=72c3f4dd14b78d52f0fe1396a0c131d19e0f6aea)\n\n Clearly, the function turns into the shape of a bowl. The gradient simply needs to descend along the slope to reach the bottom. Isn't that much faster? \n\n### Slows down the problem of gradient vanishing\n\n The graph we just used has already demonstrated this advantage, but let's take a closer look. \n\n Remember this function? \n\n[ Visualization of sigmoid function.  ](https://preview.redd.it/jl3cyhojhigc1.png?width=499&format=png&auto=webp&s=2c2e2047317d99d89b9232b37fa28652eb10f7bd)\n\n Yes, that's the sigmoid function, which many neural networks use as an activation function. \n\n Looking closely at the sigmoid function, we find that the slope is steepest between -2 and 2. \n\n[ The slope of the sigmoid function is steepest between -2 and 2. ](https://preview.redd.it/j6l02trmhigc1.png?width=499&format=png&auto=webp&s=504efbe5562e9b477a4c48e943011dca7bab5fa7)\n\n If we reduce the standardized data to a straight line, we'll find that these data are distributed exactly within the steepest slope of the sigmoid. At this point, we can consider the gradient to be descending the fastest. \n\n[ The normalized data will be distributed in the steepest interval of the sigmoid function. ](https://preview.redd.it/kk0mrflphigc1.png?width=499&format=png&auto=webp&s=43d1dbc9b1a63952a41730146bfd624db97b2b4d)\n\n However, as the network goes deeper, the activated data will drift layer by layer (Internal Covariate Shift), and a large amount of data will be distributed away from the zero point, where the slope gradually flattens. \n\n[ The distribution of data is progressively shifted within the neural network. ](https://preview.redd.it/6y088bkthigc1.png?width=499&format=png&auto=webp&s=69ebded75578b8a0daad7874d3803b926db74363)\n\n At this point, the gradient descent becomes slower and slower, which is why with more neural network layers, the convergence becomes slower. \n\n If we standardize the data of the mini\\_batch again after each layer's activation, the data for the current layer will return to the steeper slope area, and the problem of gradient vanishing can be greatly alleviated. \n\n[ The renormalized data return to the region with the steepest slope.  ](https://preview.redd.it/pmkgqpuwhigc1.png?width=499&format=png&auto=webp&s=84ce3916984707d86f314a3dc458f403b0584999)\n\n### Has a regularizing effect\n\n If we don't batch the training and standardize the entire dataset directly, the data distribution would look like the following: \n\n[ Distribution after normalizing the entire data set. ](https://preview.redd.it/a0nuru70iigc1.png?width=484&format=png&auto=webp&s=5bd763b5d450599cb6527089e01b0a1735aac4cb)\n\n However since we divide the data into several batches and standardize the data according to the distribution within each batch, the data distribution will be slightly different. \n\n[ Distribution of data sets after normalization by batch. ](https://preview.redd.it/of8wlwc2iigc1.png?width=484&format=png&auto=webp&s=16ad7cf81a7c08512399e7681ff3bce8568d11e7)\n\n You can see that the data distribution has some minor noise, similar to the noise introduced by Dropout, thus providing a certain level of regularization for the neural network. \n\n## Conclusion\n\n Batch normalization is a technique that standardizes the data from different batches to accelerate the training of neural networks. It has the following advantages: \n\n* Speeds up model convergence.\n* Slows down the problem of gradient vanishing.\n* Has a regularizing effect.\n\n Have you learned something new? \n\n Now it's your turn.

            "Great visuals! This post does a great job of explaining why normalization (general not batch) works. Though, I still feel the justification for batch normalization is very weak. I think there is a risk in creating a false sense of understanding, as it causes people to stop asking the question 'why'. 'Adding noise for a regularization effect' doesn't give an indication for why batchnorm would be preferred over the other countless ways of randomly perturbing the data. \n\nHere is a 2018 Nuerips paper showing that batch norm does not actually reduce CVS: https://arxiv.org/abs/1805.11604. Batch Norm is a great case study of something empirically working in certain settings (not RL for instance) and then having people try to retroactively come up with theoretical justifications. When these theoretical justifications are wrong, there is little pressure to correct them because the true justification is empirically based.\n\nFrom another paper https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/9238401: \"Despite the success of batch normalization (BatchNorm) and a plethora of its variants, the exact reasons for its success are still shady.\"",

I really hoped the industry would give me more practical applications of my knowledge; I was wrong.\n\nSince I joined the company I've been bouncing back and forth between different projects where I would have plenty of meetings discussing general stuff, without ever going into the details. Every time we were getting to something concrete it was said that I shouldn't do any development, as this is the task of subcontractors. Even when I managed to build some products that I think were pretty cool, after just a few months the same products ended up forgotten into a drawer because were built with already outdated requirements (a management issue). \n\nNowadays I just spend my days working on personal projects as the tasks that I'm assigned to are fairly easy and don't require me too much time. Plus, I'm working on stuff that I'm pretty sure nobody will ever use. Why do I know that? I could be literally gone for days and almost nobody would realize. I shouldn't really complain as I'm not working many hours and payed more than enough, but being constantly without motivation is definitely not good...\n\nIn the end I'd just like to be useful and to build something that I know will serve a purpose. Is it really hard to do that in big companies? Is there anyone in the same position as me?",

How can I get the first job?\n4. Will IA replace DS jobs?\n5. Now and then also there are the \"I don't like math, how can I work with DS\", or the \"do I really need to learn advanced math?\" where by advanced math people mean linear algebra and calculus.\n\nI understand that these are honest questions, but they have been already asked billions of times. Also, it is kind of astounding how people want to work with a technical field, hence you need to be constantly learning things and searching for answers, and yet they don't even bother to search if the same question was already asked on the sub. I mean, this is not even hard to do, you don't even have to be on reddit, just post on google reddit + question and google will show the it.\n\nIn my opinion this is bad for the sub as an online forum. Compare, e.g., with stackexchange. If a question was already asked people will shut it as duplicate and link to the previous post where it was already answered. This is bad, imo, because, it floods the sub and prevents people from having good discussions about the topic of the sub. I mean, it is quite some time that I don't see a real DS post here.\n\nI know that it can sound like a rant, but I understand r/datascience as a forum where people go to talk about DS and honestly I miss seeing these posts, e.g., people talking about how they solved some particular problem, talking about research papers and etc.\n\nAnd last but not least, I know that DS was hyped and people think that it is the new \"dev\" job to get easy money.

        "content": "Abstract:  \nThis project presents a comparative sentiment analysis of the Quran and Bible, using a bag-of-words approach and the NRC lexicon. **It is important to note that the analysis conducted has no validity in a religious context, and it was not intended to make any statements or draw conclusions related to religions or controversial matters.** The objective of this project was to explore the sentiment distribution and identify commonalities in language usage between these texts.\n\nMethodology:  \nThe project involved data preprocessing, including text cleaning and transformation into a bag-of-words representation. The NRC lexicon, a widely used sentiment lexicon, was employed to assign sentiment categories to the words. Due to the availability of English translations, the analysis was limited to the English versions of the texts.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nFlaws and Limitations:  \nTwo notable flaws should be acknowledged in this project. Firstly, the sentiment analysis was conducted on English translations of the Quran and Bible. This introduces a potential limitation, as nuances of sentiment expression in the original languages might not be fully captured. Further studies analyzing the sentiment of the texts in their original languages are warranted for a comprehensive analysis.\n\nAdditionally, the sizes of the Quran and Bible significantly differ, with the Bible being much larger. While this could introduce bias in sentiment distribution due to varying amounts of text, it is intriguing to note that despite this difference, the percentages of sentiments exhibited in both texts were remarkably similar. This observation highlights the potential universality of sentiment expression in religious texts, independent of their size or specific content.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nResults and Visualizations:\n\n&#x200B;\n\n[Main Dashboard](https://preview.redd.it/vbm5jkgyv21b1.png?width=1654&format=png&auto=webp&s=35249a22e0dc2c4cead0162db85588414d6490fb)\n\n[Top 15 Words](https://preview.redd.it/xr4smkgyv21b1.png?width=1654&format=png&auto=webp&s=d79a1fefbc94ce1c97dada9f46666ccde55c43c1)\n\n&#x200B;\n\nSpecial Thanks to **usersnamesallused** **,** **TinkTinkz** **,** **alfie1906** and other friends in the community for helping me with their critique on my last project.",

Or the Hadith (things the prophet Muhammad said) compared to red letters in the Bible (things Jesus said). Lot of caveats would be required for these comparisons, but again, could be fun.",
            "\nEDIT:\nReading some of your conclusions in the comments, you should really avoid making broad statements about whether a religion/text is \u201ckinder\u201d or more \u201chateful\u201d based on a fickle measurement like sentiment. For example, if I say \u201cyou\u2019re fucking awesome, dude!\u201d most sentiment lexicons will flag that as negative because of the profanity, unable to tell it\u2019s not the operative word. And what if a passage of text features an evil antagonist who does and says bad things, and the moral of the parable is to not be like that character? Is the text then hateful? Even more complex approaches like transformer-based sentiment models are still trained for a task that is extremely subjective.\n\nORIGINAL REPLY:\nAs someone who has done many projects similar to this one, I just want to point out that a term-frequency/lexicon approach like this (and indeed most NLP/textmining approaches) often winds up saying as much about the individual translator as it does about the source work. Religious texts written in old languages especially have a serious open-endedness in how they can be translated. \n\nA translator\u2019s choices in which synonyms to use, how to conjugate verbs, or how to approximate the seemingly ubiquitous idioms in these texts can artificially distinguish between two texts that are much more similar in their meaning or original manuscripts.\n\nConversely, translation can also drown out the elements of authorial voice that make a piece of text unique.\n\nIf you want to take the next step in this analysis, I would advise getting your hands on the older source texts for each of these works, then you can try using the awesome CLTK library that can help parse old/extinct languages!",

All that's been done here is taking a corpus of text, run a precanned pipeline on it to bucket it into pre-defined sentiment buckets then plotted a histogram of theses buckets. You've not even provided an interpretation for what the results tell us, just the classic data scientist dump the plots and done. It doesn't even pass the standard for data analyst. \n\nSomeone run the same task on ChatGPT Code Interpreter and I guarantee you will see better results.\n\nWe can expect much better of ourselves.

            "I recently came across a youtube channel that discussed how mistranslations ended up in the King James bible. Like for instance, how the word for Adam's \"rib\" that Eve came from was translated as \"side\" or \"half\" in all other occurrences of the same word in the rest of the bible. Or how the word that got translated into \"heart\" actually derived from the more logical center of one's self and not the emotional like the modern idea of heart. I think the English translation could end up with opposite meanings than the original, not just missed nuances."

It will also be easier to pick up the logic behind certain principles within your domain, as you'll get better intuition. Part of this should be learning logic (whether you count this as math or philosophy is up to debate).\n\nI am just thinking out loud and kind of looking for confirmation bias, because I've been learning all the juicy ML algorithms and libraries, programming languages etc in the past few years.

On more than one occasion I\u2019ve done this and I\u2019ve switched jobs down the road\n-take an hour a day to learn a new skill in demand (I\u2019m down AWS data engineering and ML LLMs)\n-spend 3-4 hours applying for jobs and when you do contact the recruiter on LinkedIn and let them know you applied (it got me a first round at a company In interviewing with next week)\n-be willing to take contract work right now while the economy is contracting (that once lead me to a full time position at a top tech company)\n-I\u2019m seriously when I say this, spend the first part of your day cleaning your space and exercising, it helps and it\u2019s productive\n-meditate"

            "One way is to look at the distribution of your data. For example if your data has a normal distribution then you'd expect most of the data to be near the mean with less data further away. You can calculate the standard deviation of your data and then look to constrain your tails.\n\nFor example I build insurance risk models and with anything like that you are going to get some weird results. So taking personal injury data we see an average of around \u00a36,000, but it can (fortunately rarely) run into the millions. That's a problem - not because the outlier isn't real (it very much is) or because it doesn't have to be taken into account (it very much does) but because it is so big it screws up the model for the rest of the data and throws my base predictions out.\n\nTo compensate I look at the distribution of the data, and compare to the real world (something we often forget). What I see is a large amount of claims around \u00a33k - \u00a39k, a few \u00a320k-\u00a3100k, and then very few up around \u00a31m+. So I split my models up. I build a \"typical\" injury model for the low end which has all of my claims in regardless of size of claim, and I pair it to a severity model that only looks at claims in this range (this is typically unprovable soft tissue damage, like whiplash). That's my base model.\n\nThen I build a model to look at my serious injury claims, between \u00a320k up to around \u00a3125k. The distribution for these claims is sound, and I know that there is an MoJ (government) portal to handle things below \u00a320k so these claims are all alike. But why \u00a3125k at the upper level? Well this is where our reinsurance kicks in. And then I stead of building a frequency prediction of this data I instead build a propensity model. So not how many claims are there, but of my typical frequency model what is the propensity that it will be a serious injury. Then I repeat the same for the really large claims.\n\nBuilding a propensity model rather than a prediction model helps a lot. My rare outlier huge injuries are so rare that it is hard to build any sort of model on that data at all. So the propensity model distributes those large claims among all the more-likely-to-have-an-injury-in-the-first-place claimants. It's a step above just summing it up and applying it equally (there's a propensity for young drivers to have injury claims, and among injury claims there's a propensity for young drivers to have large claims).\n\nIt can really depend a lot on the data and the reasons it exists. But look at real life reasons and look at distributions and ask yourself if your outliers are sufficiently different that they should be rounded up into their own propensity model.",

Are these outliers legitimate? Is it okay if you don't catch them? Use regularization.\n\n\n3.) Is it critical that you catch these outliers? Consider using:\n\n3a. Anomaly detection model to catch the outliers, then run them through a separate classifier.\n\n3b. Heavily weight outliers in the single classifier.\n\n3c. Use a very robust model.",
            "One way is to use your eyeballs and visualize the data using graphs like histograms, boxplots, or scatterplots. Outliers might show up as weird dots or points that are way off from the others. Another way is to use fancy-schmancy statistical tests like z-scores or IQR to catch the outliers. These tests basically look at how far a data point is from the average and can help you pinpoint outliers that might be hiding in the data. Of course, sometimes you just need to use your good old-fashioned brain power to spot an outlier. If you know your data and your domain, you might be able to tell when a data point is way off from what it should be. Once you've spotted an outlier, what do you do? Well, you have a few options. You could just straight-up delete the outlier from the dataset. But, be careful, this could lead to some important information being lost. Alternatively, you could transform the data using logarithmic or power transformations to make the outliers less impactful. Or, you could use some more advanced statistical methods that are less sensitive to outliers. I learned this from [consoleflare.com](https://consoleflare.com)\n\nSo, there you have it! Spotting and dealing with outliers can be a pain, but with a little bit of effort and some handy techniques, you'll be able to get rid of those pesky outliers in no time."

            "Well, tell them that you absolutely love the enthusiasm from management because as a data expert it's really nice to have management's interest on your side.\n\nThen you give a (series of) talk(s) about what generative AI can and can't do.  Show examples, show numbers, share your expertise. You take whatever crackpot article they give you, then you take the asker and the question seriously and you show what the high fly speak actually means and where it falls short. Where is the article right, where is it misleading, what boundary conditions doesn't it touch - where is it outright incorrect?\n\nYou highlight the cost and the time investment necessary for the crackpot project - which is generally a good thing because you're happy that management is looking to allocate resources! But you also show why going another way for that use case is preferable - you take their article/use case, you try and show how \"good\" or rather: \"bad\", this approach will be. And you show a tool that can do exactly what they want at a much better efficiency and lower cost. Bonus points if it's also an AI tool like ML.\n\nThen you also point out use cases that could be done with ChatGPT - because it's a good tool, it's a good marketing vector for DS in general and again: management interest is a good thing. You highlight a few use cases that are specifically ChatGPT material - maybe even existing projects within your company. You can also always ask what their expectation is:\n\n- Is it general interest and unearthing the company's potential over the next 6-18 months? That's cool, then explain the best approach for that problem and do that.\n\n- Or do they want cold, hard numbers on efficiency gained and money saved by the end of the quarter? That's also cool, then explain the best approach for that problem and do that.\n\nChances are they haven't given it much thought yet and it sparks a discussion - that's a good thing.\n\nIs it tiring and exhausting? Yeah. But it's also an opportunity to turn things to your favour.\n\nGenerally, I've also found it useful to have at least one person from the peer group you're presenting to on board before you give the presentation. They can translate what you're presenting to their peers, show examples, give comments. Just by their different viewpoint and their different relationship with the rest of the audience, they can get your points across in a much different way and, of course, with a different standing.",
            "\\[Wholy crap that became a wall of text....\\]\n\nI have a somewhat similar role in my company, also talking a lot to management. We have different events of varying length from C-Level to normal employees in which we give some highlevel introfuction to AI. So far the feedback has been very positive and we got invited to several other events for it.\n\nWe start by, why it is important and why we need to invest. Some public numbers of estimated growth and we boldly compare it to the industrial revolution and that it may have the same implications. Here we also have some kind of timeline to visualize how rapidly the development speed increases in the past 10 years. Next we follow up with General AI (non-existant) vs Narrow AI. After that we go into a highlevel overview of the different approaches that are usually summarized by \"AI\" (god I hate that term...), so statistics, optimization, ML,... and then go on to explain that ML itself has many different approaches. There is a visual on how it breaks down from AI -> ML -> NNs etc. It's actually one of the most important visuals we have (as stated by the top management not by me) since it helps to understand how all those terms are related with each other. Depending on how much time we have we sometimes follow with an explanation of NNs and were the similarities to a natural brain are and in which aspects they are different.\n\nWe follow by explaining why and when to use ML and why traditional programming fails under certain circustances (cats and dogs help a lot here). After that we explain that a successful ML project requires much more than the ML code and that in fact it is just a small part of the overall effort. (Data pipelines, governance, legal, hardware and software infrstructure, and company culture are some important aspects). Depending on how much time we have we then follow up with a small toy demo on cats and dogs, showing how easy such things can be trained (sometimes) and use this to showcase some problems like domain shifts. This part can be interactive. \n\nAfter that ChatGPT, what does the term mean, how does it work by predictiong word by word in an autoregressive way. Next, what can you do with it drafts, summaries, information retrieval etc. Depending on whom you speak to also potential applications within the company and synergies, but only with higher management, that's boring AF for regular employees. Next, limitations: limited to fall 2021, no factual correctness, no logic, human biases, many just in the cloud, data leaks when using public services. After that some info on the internal service and guidlines.\n\nAfter that we follow with internal Use Cases we are already working on or which you consider as promising if you don't already have some. The idea here is that as soon as they see actual applications it makes it much easier for a non-techi to relate to and come up with their own ideas on where this can be useful and where they have problems that might be solvable with ML.\n\nThe whole thing is about 2 hours, but the different parts vary in length depending on whom we speak to. In my experience it is extremely important to make all the explanations as simple as possible. No formulas, no math, you will lose people when even showing this stuff on a slide, just don't. For a highlevel understanding it's not even necessary.\n\nIn your current situation, I'd take it as an opportunity. ChatGPT as unrealistic as many people may think about it has created a lot of positive momentum in my company to an extend I did not believe would be possible. Take them with you but carefully and patiently explain them, why certain things are not possible. You will feel like a broken record after a while but imo one of the most important things is to educate the business side. Those are the people who need to find the problems for you to solve. Especially in a larger company a data science team cannot find the problems to solve and solving something you thought of as a problem just to realize that no one wants your cool solution is very demotivationg for everybody. Plus now you have spent money on something that had no impact -> management will question those investments. I would start by thinking about how you want to structure data science within your company. I believe a hybrid approach with a central expert team and decentralized product owners/managers etc. who understand the basics have the expert knowledge on the problem to be solved works the best. They need to identify the problems worth working on. Besides that what else do you need? Infrastructure? Data? Visibility and education of employees? Prepare that upfront and suggest solutions and approaches. Depending on the size of the company you will probably have to repeat those things quite often until they happen, but you already have the momentum generated by the enthusiasm of the management. Just ride that wave :)"

I've already applied these learnings to help friends land decent jobs, so I hope it helps you too. This is particularly aimed at those starting their careers in data.\n\nA bit about me: I have 7 years of statistics education and a Master's from a reputable U.S. public school. Graduated amid COVID, I became a model & bottle promoter in Europe while freelancing as a data scientist/analyst. Landed a corperate Data Analyst role last month.\n\n1: Experience Over Education\n\nYour education should solely be a stepping stone to gain experience, be it through internships, entry-level positions, or research. Don't overestimate the power of theoretical knowledge; practical experience reigns supreme. Grades only serve as a ticket to initial experiences.\n\n2 and 3: Refer to Point 1\n\n4: Understanding HR/Recruiters\n\nWhen writing your resume or preparing for interviews, keep it simple but impactful. Recruiters skim through resumes, so your accomplishments should stand out and be quantifiable. Misrepresenting numbers isn't advisable but emphasizing impact is.\n\n5: Always Be Active\n\nIf you're job-hunting, always have a project in the works. Freelance gigs are relatively easy to find, and they add valuable experience to your resume. Keep records of your work\u2014publish articles, maintain a GitHub repository, or hold onto contracts.\n\n6: Networking and Luck\n\nNetworking is crucial, and often it's not about what you know but who you know. Being at the right place at the right time can spell success. Lack of social skills will be a bottleneck to career growth even when technical skills are stellar.\n\n7: Company Culture vs Reality\n\nCompanies may claim to value innovation and talent, but what they're really looking for are reliable candidates who won't mess up. They're impressed by practical business experience, not academic projects or grades. Phrases like \"innovative culture\", \"entrepreneurial\",  \"solving the largest problems\", \"looking for the most talented people\", etc. are all lies especially for starting out.\n\n8: Avoid Targeting Remote Jobs\n\nTargeting only remote jobs was my biggest mistake. Remote positions usually require a significant amount of experience, so aim for local opportunities or consider relocating.\n\nFinal Words\nAlways prioritize your needs over the company's. Don't shy away from promoting yourself or taking new offers even at the last minute. Most companies are self-centered, and as an employee, you should adopt the same approach to your advantage.\n\nHope this helps, and I'd love to hear your thoughts!",

            "Can\u2019t emphasize enough that experience > education. Some roles will only get filled by PhD\u2019s or Master\u2019s, but usually a Bachelors is fine. At my first Data Analyst job, I had the same pay rate as new coworkers who got a masters right after bachelors. Reason? My manager said \u201csame effectiveness at solving problems.\u201d My coworkers just had more theory under their belt which they likely wouldn\u2019t be able to apply.\n\nI have so many friends that leaped into a Masters of Stats from bachelors in Stats just because they didn\u2019t know what they wanted to do yet, one of them outright said \u201cIm doing this because I realized I don\u2019t like working.\u201d\n\nWork first, see what you like, then specialize with grad school if it\u2019s the only way to the role. Life is short. Don\u2019t waste 2 years and $50k, you might not even like the job.\n\nI\u2019m speaking only on my experience.",
            "What if you desperately need a remote job? \n\nI want to be a digital nomad dangit.",
            "Lesson I learnt was don't wait too long to get the high CTC. You have to make compromise at some point. It's better get an ok money now and then after an year you can target higher. It will only get harder and desperate over time.\n\nFrom experience many recruiters don't consider freelance gigs as relevant experience even if they are. Technical interviewers don't mind freelance, it's mainly the HR department."

        "content": "Like a lot of people who studied data science, i spend a lot more of my career looking at analytics, reporting and visualisation these days - lets face it, thats where the bulk of the value and jobs are in most industries.\n\nI spend my first few years working in teams that used R (mostly) or Python. And SQL, obviously. Basically understanding and investigating stuff was done in SQL, visualisation, dashboards, packs were done in R (shout out to ggplot2).\n\nI now work in consulting, where i get to see a lot of industry analytics teams and a lot of the analytics teams i work with these days are \"no code\" teams.\n\nThese teams use click and drag tools for ETL, analytics, visualisation and reporting (qlikview, dataiku, power bi, sas EG, alteryx, informatica). There are entire analytics and even engineering functionalities within some companies where noone can code.\n\nNow these tools are expensive as hell - but they are time efficient, reduce a lot of IT risk around data access, and limit the amount of fuckery a single rogue idiot can wreak.\n\nMy question is, as these tools become more entrenched in major organisations is there any role for analysts that can code?\n\nTo be honest, im biased - i love coding, so i want to believe there is a future for it. But also dont want to bury my head in the sand either, if coding is going the way of the typewriter.",

            "Perspective: I've been a pro software developer for 37 years. People\\[1\\] have talked about replacing code and programmers with point and click tools for all of those 37 years. There are now more programmers than ever. Coding is the best approach for some kinds of problems. Point and click tools are the best approach for other kinds of problems. Neither is going away.\n\n\\[1\\] Mostly in marketing.",
            "All of these no code systems faces the same problem: a lack of flexibility. So you probably wont worry about it in IT sector but there is a problem If we are talking about research and data science is kind of research. Just an opinion.",
            "I always say: if you know the stats, the coding is easy.\n\nSure, Power BI and the like will continue to develop and service a lot of the data needs of no-coders. But it only works on established data models.\n\nSAS JMP has been around for years and years, but people still take up R and Python to do statistics. Why? Because they\u2019re not that damn difficult and for many data science tasks you really need to script your work so it\u2019s repeatable and can be developed upon. It really sucks to do advanced things in point and click software.\n\nPeople tend to think any kind of coding is some weird voodoo pact. It\u2019s completely open and well documented, you just have to put in the work to learn it. The math, logic and statistics behind it is far more difficult to learn imo.\n\nSo to answer your question: No. I actually think the future is more coders and less no code software. Because co-pilots and gpt\u2019s will make coding easier and coding is superior to UIs.",

            "Early in my career, **for sure**. I needed to upskill faster for the career growth I wanted. That included a lot of CS-type stuff that isn't in my academic background, more ML type stuff, etc. DS makes your wear a lot of hats!\n\nNow, as a senior DS? Sure, but it's not the same at all. I do a lot more bookmarking, casual stuff, and then I dig in more deeply on company time as my projects allow. As a senior there's also a mentorship aspect to that (or maybe that's me rationalizing?) because I do share interesting links / topics with teammates if it's relevant to their work.\n\nEdit: @OP, based on some of your past posts/comments, I'll target a few thoughts.\n\n* It is common (but not guaranteed) for DS work to have \"learn how to solve new problem X time\" built in. This is especially true if you're on a newer team or DS is new to your org and you're a bunch of generalists getting bizarre, malformed questions thrown your way.\n\n* It is common in DS to feel like everyone knows stuff and you don't. Given the broad backgrounds and diverse paths to the field, it is easy to get math/stats (or even CS) \"envy\". If you're forcing yourself to study outside of work because you feel imposter syndrome, you really need to take objective stock of your skills. Don't risk burnout because of a phony feeling of inadequacy.\n\n * If you regularly feel like you're getting buried in requests beyond your skills, really figure out if you have bad management / a terrible pipeline for requests, or if you're missing skills. Work with your manager to fill those skills and to set the right expectation with stakeholders (unless the problem is your management sucks -- in that case, get out and save yourself).\n\n* If I'm way off and assuming things like a prick, ignore me entirely. Maybe someone else will get something out of the ramblings, though.",
            "I'm a mid-skill DS/DA. I still study on my own time but I'm getting to the point where I have a strong foundation in statistics, predictive modeling, data analysis, R, SQL and Tableau. The only area I have to catch up is Python. Once that's at a decent level, I'll study primarily during company time and only casually on my own time (reading a book/article). Once you get the fundamentals down, the more complex methods have steep diminishing returns. It's more about developing domain knowledge, social skills/network, communication, etc.\n\nI would love to hear other people's experiences.",

Definitely ran into some leetcode hards. \n* MLE leaning roles will ask for knowledge on how to productize DS projects. Knowledge of AWS and containers is sort of expected.\n* DS roles expect at least some idea of how neural networks work, sometimes how transformers work.\n\nWhat has not changed and will probably remain the same:\n\n* SQL still very relevant, not much change in difficulty.\n* Classification metrics.\n* Ability to translate business problems into DS action items.\n* Hypothesis testing.",

I fell into a position that was somewhere between an analyst and data scientist, learning /getting taught the DS skills on the job.\n\nI was interviewing people for a junior DS role recently and we had to take the job down within 24 hours as we'd already got more applications than we could reasonably review. I ended up interviewing 6 people, all of whom had a relevant masters, solid coding/programming skills, and a decent understanding of DS as a field. With the exception of lacking real woo experience, they were probably all roughly at the level I was at after a few years on the job.\n\nThe competition is stiffer now, there are more universities and bootcamps churning out people with a mish-mash of DS skills, and the internet is full of resources.",

It\u2019s almost as if these HR and hiring managers just wanted to slap as much buzz words into job posting for jr DA thinking they are the same as Data Scientists and it will give them the bang for their bucks.

            "I was a DA from 2011. I did my first DS interview back in 2014. I failed horribly and many more since. I got my first DS role in 2016 staying on my team at the time, just changing roles by the placement of our COO. Since then I've passed multiple interviews and got dozens of offers from companies of all types and sizes. I worked at a < 50 person startup and a Fortune 500 company. Some of the interviews I didn't pass were legitimately really hard. So hard I honestly do not believe they were necessary, nor indicative of the role. Some I failed and got feedback that was laughable in a good light and maddening from my personal perspective. \n\nI honestly do not believe the hiring bar has gotten harder. Instead I think companies have realized DS is not a good fit for most people straight out of college, nor people without sufficient programming or statistics skills. In other words, it's a role where Senior level should be the starting point. That's not my personal philosophy, but that is what the market has moved to because it's easier. It's really difficult to train early career DS and really difficult to interview because it's a guess of future potential rather than immediate contribution. Eventually, the market will have enough Senior DS that companies learn how to build entry level DS up and that will make it easier to break into the field again. With the current economy, I don't see that happening soon.",
            "I was hired into a company who later went on to add a leet code easy live coding round after a few bad experiences hiring folk who knew their stats but had massive blockers in coding up things. \n\nBack than the DS role was still evolving and many of who we\u2019d now call analysts or BI folk joined the DS hyper train assuming they\u2019d do more of the same excel or drag and drop analysis things. But they were all in for a rude awakening when it became apparent DS is way more SWE than DA/BI. Many of those couldn\u2019t cope, quit and went back to DA/BI.

They also use proportion tests, and sometimes nonparametric tests like permutation tests (though they might not call them that).\n\nHere's stuff that could be relevant to think about for FAANG A/B testing (or A/B testing in general):\n\n1. What kind of metric are you testing? Binary? Numerical? That will have some effect on your decision re: appropriate tests\n2. How do you calculate power of the test? Are you measuring rare events? Are the metrics super hard to move? What are good ways to determine the appropriate test size?\n3. A FAANG company is typically running thousands of A/B tests simultaneously at any time. How do you keep these tests from affecting each other?\n4. Sometimes, just due to random sampling error, a metric will vary slightly from the population mean in the test group. How do you correct for this? Does your correction depend on the type of metric or type of statistical test you used?\n5. Typically we A/B test on user experience, and let users be the exchangeable unit. What other things could you test on besides users? How would that change the ways the test is done?\n6. Typically metrics are broken down by many demographic groups, countries, ages, etc. What effect does that have on the interpretability of test results (i.e. multiple comparisons)?\n7. What is a p-value and how does it relate to significance?\n\nThis is all assuming you're going for a DS role.

Just a note though, take a long hard look at your data....there is probably something they put in there to throw you off.",

            "The t-test is standard in the tech industry and I've seen it used at companies like Meta, Microsoft, Airbnb, and Snap.  It's not because it's simple, it's because of the central limit theorem which states that the sampling distribution of the mean approaches a normal distribution... the normality assumption of the t-test applies at sufficient sample size.  In classic stats books, the rule of thumb is n>30, and fortunately for FAANG companies, n is typically >1M.  You can play around with other flavors of the t-test (eg. Welch's t-test), but in general they work wonderfully across a wide variety of AB testing metrics that are means.\n\nQuick plug for Statsig (where I work) where we're making all of the tools FAANG companies use for A/B tests available to everyone: [https://statsig.com/experimentation](https://statsig.com/experimentation)"

However, R and by extension RStudio/Posit, somehow has a huge attraction to me.

At least once a week RStudio is calling me so I launch it and click around (I like Quarto too btw). But the more I learn Python, the more I find R code to be weird.\n\nIn the end I just need to try learning both to find out if it's going to work out, but I like to ask the community first so I can start from a sort of baseline on those with experience in learning them at the same time.\n\nWhat are the pros and cons, do's and don'ts? Did you basically do everything twice, once in Py and once in R? Or use them for different things, perhaps EDA in R, but then move to Py for ML (or vice versa)? Would that be a good way to learn both, or even make it more complicated?\n\nA bit of background info, I'm learning this in my spare time, neither is used at my current job. Looking at job descriptions on my side of the world, the most asked of the two is Python, some ask for R, some ask for R as a second, and a few stated that either is fine.

        "content": "**Creativity**: We often focus a lot on hard skills, but creativity is the most important attribute for a data scientist. You will get some crazy requests. For example, I was once asked to build a recommendation system with NO DATA. Many other data scientists dismissed the project saying it couldn't be done. I was able to accomplish it by building a simple model were I manually entered weights depending on how important I thought each feature was. I then set up a pipeline to update these weights as real data would come in. Was it perfect? No. But it did a good enough job while we were waiting for data and made the client happy. I have had many crazy requests like this. So many data scientists out there have to be told what to do, very few can come up with creative solutions. The best never use phrases like, \"that is impossible.\" How do you learn this creativity? By working on real world problems. This skill is not developed when you are given a toy dataset and told what the output should look like. Sure, you might learn some technical modeling, but virtually no creativity. I wish more bootcamps would give \"impossible\" tasks.\n\n**Dirty Data**: I understand that provided or toy datasets can sometimes be dirty. They don't come close to real world data. Imagine you are asked to build a model using datasets you do not know exist yet, coming from source systems with little-to-no descriptions of what the features mean. Somehow you need to find the right data in a sea of millions of irrelevant features. You will need to fight political battles to even get access to the features you do not yet know if you even need. You will need to track down knowledgeable people who can tell you the weird quirks in the data (e.g. missing months were poorly imputed when this random country suffered a natural disaster 12 years ago). You then need to build a full pipeline that pulls the data from 10 different data sources that don't link to each other naturally, do regression tests because they don't update consistently, transform it, do feature engineering, feed it to a model, monitor the model for drift, redo everything after you find out a feature is completely different from what you were told, and the list goes on. This is not an exaggeration, it is typical. It goes way beyond cleaning up a few outliers and training a prototype model. This experience can only be gained by doing it.\n\n**Being easy to work with**: A bad hire can be a disaster! One person can ruin group moral and be difficult to get rid of. It can be difficult to judge personality from a few interviews. Haveing work experience where you got along with the same team for years greatly reduces that risk.\n\nThere are many others, but these are three big ones. If you don't have these skillsets, that is fine! But you have to start smaller. Get a more Jr level position where you are not expected to know all of these. Get experience working on them with more senior mentors. Even if you are one of the lucky few who get a job out of college in this market, your manager is probably clueless of these issues (i.e. won't be able to help you) and setting you up for failure. Many on this sub are looking for shortcuts or complaining about their job after they took a shortcut. You will have a much better career if you take the patient route.",

As you said, focus on initial traction rather than qualifications.",
            "Several thoughts:\n\n**Your worst enemy is 100% going to be bad recruiters and lazy HR departments**. Bad recruiters are the ones who can't see talent if it slapped them in the face - they know enough about the role to pretty much only be able to find someone that fits the job description to a literal tee. Good recruiters are the ones who will figure out that a guy with 13 years of experience at GS knows some shit. So that's going to be your first barrier to get through.\n\nI don't think you have to worry as much about HR because they don't tend to get as picky with super experienced hires wrt education. They're normally going to be more strict when you're talking about hiring someone with 1-3 years of experience as to whether it's that + a BS, MS or PhD, because that does make a difference (really just in overall YOE).\n\n**Your existing network will help, probably more than you think.** As you said, your network may be heavy NY and London financials - but that's your 1st degree professional network. \n\nThis is something I always tell people: if you're the right person for the job, then all you really need is for someone to personally ask the hiring manager to read your resume. And a 2nd or even 3rd degree connection is more than enough to do that.\n\nSo yeah, your buddy also works at GS. But odds are that among all the people in your network, there's a really, really high chance that someone has a parent, sibling, spouse, close friend, classmate, former coworker, neighbor, kid's friend's parents, tinder match, etc. who works at the company you're interested in - especially if it's a large company.\n\nNot only that - think of your non-professional network. Think of your friends, college classmates, college professos, college TAs, family friends, relatives, etc. Odds are either one of them already works there, or one of them knows someone who does.\n\nI'll give you an example: I have never worked in the bay area, and I have never worked in the FAANG tech sector. And yet, I have 1st degree connection there that has nothing to do with my professional network. It's my best friend's buddy, who he met while doing a work abroad program in London. They met, became great friends, then my buddy moved to San Francisco and they became roommates. I then met him a bunch of times, including helping him find his keys at Coachella when he was too intoxicated to walk. I think I can get a referal from him. \n\nOr picking another random one: IBM. When I was a teenager, I used to play tennis. One of the guys that I used to be in training with? Now works at IBM. Also, one of my friends from back in my dorm days - who I ran into when we both realized we had kids in the same swimming lessons? IBM. \n\nPinterest - my wife's best friend/maid of honor at my wedding. Uber? Her previous job. Nerdwallet - her husband. Intuit - her husband's previous job. \n\nI definitely have some more \"formal\" relationships in other big companies, but there are tons of companies where I know people through weird connections - and oddly enough, connections that would be more likely to give me a referal. \n\n>**I understand academic rigor. How can/should I convey this when applying?**\n\nI don't think you need to worry too much about it, but the key here is that recruiters are not going to pick up on this. They don't generally even know what is the value of a MS or Phd.\n\nWhat you need to focus on is making sure that your resume reflects that. And there, the question you need to ask yourself is \"what projects have I worked on that would highlight the fact that I didn't just plug everything into xgboost but actually worked on fundamentals?\". Some things that always stand out to me is talking about variations of problems that challenge standard assumptions (i.e., non-Gaussian distributions, heteroskedasticity, non-iid, handling colinearity, developing analytics solutions to problems, dealing with outliers, etc)"

Find ways to stand out\n2. Make sure your resume is exceptionally well written\n3. Network - reach out to everyone in your professional network and let them know personally you're looking for jobs and that you'd appreciate a referal. This works in cases where they are already personally aware of someone who is looking for data scientists.\n4. Scout the careers websites for employers where you have strong connections, and then ask them to refer you. This is work that you want to do - do not expect your connections to do it for you. \n5. Consider the possibility of taking jobs that may be a level slightly lower than where you were before, and then prepare to build that career track back up."

            "Without knowing the company in particular, here's some general interview advice for DS in 2024:\n\nYes, LLMs are amazing, yes LLMs are hot right now, and YES they do show up in job descriptions. But in 2024 many jobs aren't actually needing in-depth experience with LLMs. They add LLM to the job description to seem sexy, because every exec is asking their team \"what's our AI strategy\" and every competitor claims to infuse AI into their products. Also, adding genAI/LLM keywords into a job description is a great way to get people to apply to the job, especially at more boring/traditional/older companies that want to seem hip and cutting edge.\n\nNow, when it comes to the interviews, I've seen that **IF** they ask about LLMs, they'll ask more project-based questions and start casually like \"oh you fine-tuned an LLM for fun or in your last work project, that's awesome, how was it?\"\n\nThen they'll strategically ask follow-up questions to gauge your depth:\n\n* What challenges did you face with fine-tuning your LLM?\n* How did you evaluate the effectiveness of the LLM?\n* Oh have you heard of RAG? Oh awesome did you try it? Did it help?\n\nCaveat: they won't be asking these casual questions at OpenAI or Anthropic or Google Brain... but 99% of us aren't interviewing at those companies.\n\nFor most companies, even in 2024, their DS interviews resort to basics like:\n\n* tell me about regression\n* tell me about L1 vs L2 penalty\n* tell me a bit about the bias-variance tradeoff\n* let's do some Python Data Structures questions or Pandas data cleaning or some SQL window functions depending on the role\n\nAnd then, they'll ask some more questions based on what you have on your resume:\n\n* Talk to me about the last ML model you deployed...how did you clean the data? why did you choose Neural Networks? how did you handle re-training and model drift?  did your PMs/customers care about explainability of the model, and how did you handle that?\n* Oh did you use Spark.. tell me 2 annoying things about Spark?\n* Oh I see you listed both PyTorch and Tensorflow.. which do you like better and why? How did you get your team to transition?\n\nShameless plug: for more thoughts on interviews, wrote 301 pages about this exact topic in the book [Ace the Data Science Interview](https://www.acethedatascienceinterview.com/) and made DataLemur to practice [SQL interview questions](https://datalemur.com/questions) for free",

One of the GPTs provided with this update by OpenAI is a Data Analysis assistant, showing the company already identified this area as a strong application for its tech.\n\nJust by providing a dataset you can start generating some simple or more advanced visualisations, including those needing some data processing or aggregations. This means anyone can interact with a dataset just using plain English.\n\nIf you're curious (and have a ChatGPT+ subscription) you can play with this [GPT](https://chat.openai.com/g/g-5CQsMRvyT-international-football-explorer) I created to explore a dataset on International Football Games (aka soccer ;) ).\n\nWhat makes it strong:\n\n* Interact in simple English, no coding required\n* Long context: you can iterate on a plot or analysis as chatGPT keeps memory of the past context\n* Capacity to generate plots or run some data processing thanks to its capacity to write and execute Python code.\n* You can use ChatGPT's \"knowledge\" to comment on what you observe and give you some hints on trends you observe\n\nI'm personally quite impressed, the results are most of the time correct (you can check the code it generated). Provided the tech was only released a year ago, this is very promising and I can easily imagine such natural language interface being implemented in traditional BI platforms like Tableau or Looker.\n\nIt is of course not perfect and we should be cautious when using it. Here are some caveats:\n\n* It struggles with more advanced requests like creating a model. It usually needs mulitple iteration and some technical guidance (e.g. indicating which model to choose) to get to a reasonable result.\n* It can make some mistakes that you won't catch unless you have a good understanding of the dataset or check the code (e.g. at some point it ran an analysis on a subset that it generated for a previous analysis while I wanted to run it on the whole dataset). You need to be extra careful with the instructions you give it and double checking the results\n* You need to manually upload the datasets for now, which makes non-technical persons still dependent on someone to pull the data for them. Integration with external databases or external apps connected to multiple APIs will soon come to fix that, it is only an integration issue.\n\nIt will definitely not take our jobs tomorrow but it will make business stakeholders less reliant on technical persons and might slightly reduce the need for data analysts (the same way tools like Midjourney reduce a bit the dependence on artists for some specific tasks, or ChatGPT for Copywriters).\n\nBelow are some examples of how you can easily require for a plot to be created with a first interpretation.\n\n  \n\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/nyts2e5verzb1.png?width=516&format=png&auto=webp&s=781a00caf22a3baae08cff12aa4f632c4e2f6f37\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/0j4nkz5verzb1.png?width=719&format=png&auto=webp&s=9fb228e7d5e0d49ab01fc5487a6e093dd2fbd5d0\n\n  \n",

Here's a quick blurb about the article.\n\nAI in healthcare faces a critical issue: our obsession with cutting-edge technology often overshadows the actual impact on patients. Successfully bringing AI medical devices to market entails much more than excellent diagnostic performance; it requires rigorous clinical trials and comprehensive cost-effectiveness analyses. HeartFlow's AI-powered cardiac imaging product FFRCT is a perfect example of that. In this blog post, I critically review FFRCT and discuss broad lessons for the future of AI medical devices.\n\nIf you're interested in evidence-based medicine, AI/ML, health economics, and envisioning the future of healthcare, this blog post is for you. What do you think the biggest barrier for AI in healthcare is? Let me know in the comments!",

            "A lot of what\u2019s needed is just unglamorous shit like making systems usable and data less of a shit show.",
            "I also work in a healthcare-centered data science role. I like what you\u2019re saying about determining whether a technology-enabled device is a good fit for a patient - that\u2019s a lot of my day-to-day. Beyond the obvious \u201cdo they fit the medical profile which would benefit from this device\u201d, the fact of the matter is that healthcare revolves largely around an aging population that has an inherent distrust of technology. We can give patients non-emergency medical devices, and we have no oversight over whether the patient actually interacts with their device and learns to use it, much less if they feel safe with it. The onus will increasingly be on data scientists and physicians to help their patients learn about the tech-enabled devices and feel comfortable using them. As much as we ask questions about \u201cdo we think a patient will benefit from this device?\u201d, we also need to focus on whether we think they\u2019ll actually be open to the idea of using a medical device recommended or powered by AI/ML technology.",
            "Seems like the issue re HeartFlow's FFRCT is two-fold\n\n1. They developed a feature, not a product, in FFRCT\n2. Their use case for FFRCT alone does not fit well into the current clinical pipeline from a public health perspective\n\nI don't think there's an issue with developing with retrospective in mind (actually innovative if anything). Additionally, once they've gotten FDA approval, clinical effectiveness become an afterthought (as long as it can sell / get reimbursed). They seem to have addressed these issues via integration into a more comprehensive software suite.\n\nNonetheless I largely agree with you on the lessons. The infra for healthcare is generally not there yet, and the pricing model still needs to be worked on. However, I am not sure if a subscription basis would fit the current financial model for healthcare (I am also not familiar with how funding works in the US; but in general private practices in Australia where I am from, a per-use basis is a lot easier to justify the cost)",
            "An important concept when discussing AI for healthcare is the level to which model predictions are supervised by humans and their ability to cause harm. \n\nAI for drug discovery generally has no more ability to cause harm - it's often better than a squinting graybeard saying \"let's add a carbonyl group here\", and the drug goes through all the same screening regardless of how it was designed. And you need fancy models to make this work well.\n\nAI assistants for physicians are significantly more risky because the physician can tune out and the model can introduce its own biases.\n\nOf course, AI directly acting on patients is the most risky."

Apparently they were afraid to death that the feedback they give (i.e. the reason for rejection) may sound discriminatory to a crazy candidate and lead to a lengthy complaint process (or even litigation), so they had a blanket \"ghosting\" policy for unsuccessful candidates regardless of the position type.\n\nOn a somewhat related note - people love ghosting nowadays and end decades-old marriages with a short text, and you seriously expect *constructive feedback* from a person you've seen a few times in your life?

Human Resources may be different at other companies, but it takes time to do some extra vetting. Are you who you say you are on your resume? Did you go to school or have previous experience? References? \n\n3. Budgets at companies are fluid. Organization changes happen, too. A sure thing might mean a decision delayed. Applications are put on hold. Sometimes, the hiring manager is in the same boat of not knowing when they can pull the trigger. They're waiting for a definitive answer themselves.

The other teams seem to have work but they won't let me on to even shadow because they want to prioritize utilization for their employees. My team has no data science work or data to play with. The Solutions Data Scientist role is weird because it is client-facing so if the clients don't want to engage, there is no work.

            "> Is this the reality with Data Science roles?\nIt shouldn't be. Like in any other area, having teams that are idle doesn't make any sense. It speaks for mismanagement of some kind or other. \n\nFor non-tech companies it can happen that the data maturity is too low or the processes within a company don't align with what is necessary to do 'data-driven' work.\n\nWhat does your supervisor, what does your team say? Are they equally frustrated, do they have projects? Is everyone just sitting around the whole day? If you really can't find any work, I assume that you've talked with your supervisor? What did they say?\n\n> I'm also kind of concerned about Chat GPT4. My company sells products in the NLP space and with Chat GPT4, I feel like our products will be pretty obsolete soon.\n\nI'm not working in that space, myself. Having said that, now that it is so popular, every company on the earth will want a similar solution to ChatGPT for their own data. Skills in this area just have become more valuable. \n\nI recently read about security breaches where Samsung employees uploaded sensitive data to OpenAI servers.  I'm sure Samsung and others will have demand for people who can help write guidelines, sensibly limit the use of ChatGPT or who can develop local models or implementations. Also, any company that wants to make their large corpus of information and documents accessible as an internal knowledge-base will have a need for experts. Open AI can't/won't cover them all.\n\nIt's a bit like the invention of the iPhone, try not to be Nokia or BlackBerry but there is plenty of non-Apple mobile phones companies who are doing well 20 years later because they kept up and kept innovating.\n\nI get the frustration of having the lonely job of sourcing ML projects that no one is necessarily looking for. In some aspects that can be part of our job to do exploration and to find value - but this kind of work needs a certain level of support for the data scientists, too, as well as integration into the broader company.\n\nNot having any work for months on end would frustrate me. Personally, I'd try and work through the frustration and upskill - though, realistically I could probably only keep this up for a year at max...\n\nIf you're interested in product management, can you maybe shadow these guys for a while and learn more about the job?",

Got hired by an \"artificial intelligence manager\" who was supposed to foster an AI revolution within a relatively known company in my country. Five months later, without a single tangible project to show (because everything this manager did was to hire overpriced specialists), he got fired and we were pushed aside. Not long after, my peers jumped ship and I was the sole DS guy there.\n\nThe next 12 months were a nightmare because I spent a whole lot of time chasing projects and trying to build a network. The company was not data-driven at all and not even in the IT roadmaps I heard the word \"data\" a single time. When I gave the odd presentation on AI and DS, people were Disney-like amazed, but then the subject was left in oblivion very quickly. \n\nI had no official projects, no project manager, no coordinator or manager (I reported directly to an IT director), no methodologies, nothing. The company itself did not take care of their data infrastructure - if I wanted to do any harm to the data of the company, there was basically nothing that would prevent me from that.\n\nThe most mysterious thing was that my director absolutely loved me and pretty much despised lots of other employees from non-DS projects that worked a lot more than I did. During my final days in the company, this director began firing people and saying that \"everybody is bad\", but for some unknown reason he wanted to keep me at all costs.\n\nOf course I did not believe him and I left as soon as a good opportunity came in. Later on I found out that the company was basically firing everybody and my turn would eventually come. \n\nPS: Why didn't I leave the company right away just like my peers did? Well, the paycheck was very good and I could take a lot of the time for studies and personal things, but I knew it was an unsustainable situation in the long run.

Academia is one of the only place where you will have the time and the liberty to try and apply those new algorithms and methods to your data. \n\nIn a company, new methods are usually discarded for what works best and/or is the easiest to apply/well documented or even interpretable, which basically discards a vast part of deep learning.\n\nYou will end up using XGBoost everywhere or linear regression even when some methods are proven to be better.\n\nA PhD is just a diploma that attests that you are also capable to learn, adapt and construct on past knowledge in a scientific way and add to the vast edifice of Science. Go for it if you like the idea and want to be a part of it !",
            "Having been thru a PhD program, I only recommend a PhD to people who want the satisfaction of getting it for themselves and enjoy the academic process. From what I\u2019ve seen, several years of solid industry experience is on par or outweighs a PhD when it comes to technical skills and compensation. \n\nA PhD is all about learning how to teach yourself a topic in excruciating depth and then contribute new knowledge to that topic (a mile deep and an inch wide, if you will). This can be very useful when really digging into the nitty gritty details of any technical field and will certainly help when talking with your domain experts.  You probably won\u2019t apply your PhD if you enter industry and so all you can really take from it is a good time and research skills.  For example, my PhD is in fault kinematics / volcanic stratigraphy and is completely unrelated to my current job in the oil and gas industry. That said, I\u2019ve used my research experience to take deep dives into various geologic and engineering topics early in my career that would normally be reserved to mid or late career employees. However at the end of the day, my mid-career colleagues (BS and MS) and I can do about the same things and we\u2019re about the same age even, but they chose to spend more time getting practical experience in industry whereas I chose to spend it in academia researching a topic I loved but knew wasn\u2019t financially viable as a career.  I think the few other PhD\u2019s in my company would agree with this (mix of data scientists, geoscientists, and engineers).\n\nIt\u2019s really about what you want out of life. If you want freedom to research something esoteric, do a PhD. If you want to make money, go to work.",
            "While you are constantly reading many interesting headlines and different topics of research popping up here and there, every one of those papers is written by different people who each have very deep knowledge in exactly that one topic. Dont assume that every researcher knows everything.\n\nAlso: The goal of a PhD is not necessarily to do ground breaking research. Most likely, your results will not move science at all. It is to prove that you are capable to research at all. It doesnt matter if that topic isnt state of the art anymore - and if it is in ML it will very likely still be interesting for employers and sought after."

Most of my energy and efforts were spent on trying to understand statistical tests, how the models work, their underlying assumptions or how data can be processed.\n\nAll of a sudden now, I will need to go through a LeetCode style coding test to continue staying on as a data scientist. And apparently, such tests are not uncommon within data science interviews in many places? Before I had to prepare for this coding test, I don't even know what is a Linked List, Tree data structure, dynamic programming or greedy algorithms. Even now, I still don't see how being proficient in data structure and algorithm concepts will help me become a better data scientist (given that I've already survived two years without knowing such concepts, or can work on kaggle projects without ever invoking Linked List or Binary Tree).\n\nSo help me understand - how are CS concepts essential for doing data science?

It's a lazy proxy to being an effective coder and an even more removed proxy to general intelligence.\n\nA lot of DS and DA jobs I post get 500-2000 applicants. I understand the impulse to thin it down using LeetCode, even if I don't think that's right to do.\n\nThat said, I learned advanced coding skills before my math skills advanced and that actually helped me interact with the math topics I was learning in a more hands-on fashion.",
            "So, I have two conflicting thoughts on this:\n\nOn the one hand, leetcode has nothing to do with data science ability. It is somewhat correlated to like the 2% of data science work that would deal with that type of problem statement.\n\nOn the other hand, leetcode allows you to showcase your ability to learn in a controlled environment and demonstrate your ability to problem solve creatively.\n\nUltimately, I think it's a tool that will give you very few false positives, and a lot of false negatives - i.e., you'll disqualify a lot of qualified candidates, but the ones that pass will probably be pretty good candidates.\n\nMy biggest qualm with this approach is that it biased your candidate pool towards people who have ample free time, i.e., people who have time either during work or after work hours to grind leetcode. \n\nIf you're a parent of 3 kids - hell, if you're a single parent of kids - or if you have an elderly parent you take care of, or you have a really demanding job? It's a lot harder to grind leetcode. So there's a very tacit type of discrimination that is happening in taking this approach.",
            "I think the best way to approach LeetCode is to view it as a standardized test like the SAT/ACT or GRE/GMAT. In general we know that standardized tests are not a true indication of a persons ability, but nonetheless it can still serve as a (weak/moderate) signal of their ability.",

They could ask me questions and ask for constraints as they\u2019d like, and they would eventually try to program the answer. For those who got it right, I would ask them follow up questions and for their thought process and proceed as normal.\n\nFor those that got it wrong, as long as I could see they had some amount of familiarity with programming I would actually give them a follow up interview a couple of days later. In that follow up, I would ask them whether or not they looked into the problem I gave them more and whatever they learned. Then I would ask if they\u2019d like to show me what they learned by trying again.\n\nAs silly as it sounds, I actually found some people would just get nervous at the interview or couldn\u2019t get past a mental block and would then proceed to bomb. But the people that took the time afterwards to learn from their mistakes to the point they felt confident with the answer proved they knew how to do their work, they just needed a bit more time. And it\u2019s not like we work here without computers. Very few times does someone at a non-senior level need to be excellent on the spot. Most of the time, they just need to build some confidence.\n\nI\u2019m not advocating for people to turn their out of work lives into constant programming and grinding, but if someone showed the willingness to learn from their mistakes that carried a lot of weight.

            "Depends on the type of role. This is probably how I would think about doing it. Quick disclaimer, I've never actually had to take a hiring process from beginning to end, so this would be subject to change if something weren't working. \n\n\nFor a position requiring 1-2 YOE:\n\n1. Blind the resumes. Remove name and anonymize education. At the initial filter stage I want don't want any potential subconscious biases to influence opinions on whether or not a candidate can do a job. \n\n2. Set aside referral candidates for HM review.\n\n3. Sort resumes into two piles - those with professional experience (including internships) and those with no professional experience. \n\n4. Eliminate those with no experience. Send out rejection email.\n\n5. Separate resumes into preferred experience pile and other pile. If the role is focused on product experimentation, set aside resumes with relevant experience. Same for any other domain. Preferred experience candidates get sent to HM.\n\n6. Sort resumes into more piles - those with graduate degrees, undergraduate degrees and bootcamps.\n\n7. More piles - preferred degrees (heavily depends on role responsibilities. In some cases the preferred degree is CS, in others something more stats related)\n\n8. Eliminate pile with non-preferred degree+no graduate degree.\n\n9. If further cuts are needed, preference is given to graduate degree holders. \n\n10. If even more cuts are needed, preference is given to graduate degree holders with publication history (includes research based thesis). Capstone projects are removed from consideration.\n\n\nOnce the pile of resumes is sent to the HM, the HM would create a shortlist (10 or so) of candidates to interview.\n\n**Round 1:** Interview with the HM. Standard stuff here, ask about prior roles etc. Candidates are given a pass/fail based on a standardized performance rubric.\n\n**Round 2:** Technical round. Candidates are given a choice between three options. Live coding, take home, or the option to walk the interviewer through something they've done in the past. Candidates are given a pass/fail based on a standardized performance rubric.\n\n**Round 3:** Situational round. Candidates are given a situation (marketing wants to do XYZ, how would you set it up and measure it/determine if it was successful) and walk the interviewer through their thought process. This round is scored on a ranked scale based on a standardized performance rubric. Can be combined with technical in an extended interview session (45 minutes).\n\n**Round 4:** Team fit/behavioral.

            "I would make it more transparent. I'm tired of getting into an interview and the interview being about something different to what I thought it'd be. We also don't have clear expectations for interviews. This also makes all of those scam coaching people a lot of money and they even want you to pay for information on the interview process.",
            "This is not theoretical for me, and I got good feedback in the past on my process from candidates, so I'll lay it out for you.\n\nBackground first:\n- competition has certainly massively increased since I went into data science six years ago\n- a few years back I got nearly 300 applicants for an entry level DS role, last year I got over 500 (in two weeks) for a data analyst internship\n- (mid/junior, two years of experience roles are not quite at that level yet, not in London/the UK anyway)\n- the above is pretty unsustainable; I've always been a fan of having a clear 'accepting applications' period so that people don't rush unduly and put in something high quality, but I don't feel that having one shorter than two weeks makes sense. In future I would just auto-cut the advert after 50 or 100 applicants for entry level roles.\n- the problem is that signal to noise for entry level is pretty damn high; I tended to get single digits numbers of applicants whom I'd actually hire. It's much better with the junior/mid roles.\n\nNow, the process.\n\nInitial steps:\n- advert will set out clearly (a) hard requirements and (b) nice-to-haves. Section (a) is kept as small as possible, (b) is comprehensive.\n- advert will request a CV and a short cover letter, and will indicate length of the latter and what content it should cover, and that applicants will be judged on their written communication skills. This is probably the most controversial bit, but I've become more convinced by it the more processes I've run. Any analyst or data scientist needs to be able to communicate clearly and effectively in writing - that one goes in 'essential skills'. I get very high signal from this.\n\nFirst pass:\n- once applications have closed, all applications go into a spreadsheet. Everyone gets an email to say they can expect to hear an update by the end of the following week (if there are loads of applicants).\n- the spreadsheet is a skills matrix. The essential skills and nice to haves are all on there. Each application gets a simple score (0, 1, or 2) for each skill. The score indicates evidence the applicant has the skill - 0 for no evidence, 1 if they mention it, 2 if it looks like they've got good experience.\n- every application gets read. However, on the first pass I'm just looking for those skills, so I'm reading the CV and cover letter and trying to find reasons to give people a good score, not mulling it over carefully (yet)\n- at the end of this everyone who doesn't have one of the essential skills gets cut, and receives an email to inform them\n\nSecond pass:\n- everyone else now has a numerical score, which is used for the second cut. The score is a proxy for whether they have a lot of evidence that they have many of the beneficial skills for the role. The second cut eliminates a large fraction of candidates under a certain boundary. To make it as fair as possible I make a second pass of anyone who was just under the boundary, and try to be generous. Everyone who gets cut gets an email at this point.\n- I never run over the self imposed deadline without flagging it to candidates. If I can't review everyone in time I send an email to everyone to apologise and give an updated timeline.\n\nThird pass:\n- now a more considered pass of the application materials takes place. Sometimes I send follow-up questions by email to try to make easy cuts, e.g. you sometimes find people aren't even still interested.\n- a take home technical exercise with a 60 minute (self enforced) time limit follows this. It's not fair to give it to too many people, and I've found it can't be made shorter without becoming useless and/or encouraging people to lie about how long it took ... so if there are hundreds of applicants, as in entry level roles, the second cut ends up being quite brutal. _Mea culpa_ - this is the main reason I'd auto withdraw the advert earlier in future.\n- at entry level a quite large fraction of people fail out at this point. The task is not designed to trick people, just verify they can do the basic things they said they could do. Many can't. Another large fraction are decent, but clearly less good than the best candidates.\n\nFinal stages:\n- every candidate who does the technical exercise gets detailed feedback on their solution. Many are rejected at this stage; they get feedback either way.\n- the best candidates go through to a video call. I've actually run this both ways round, e.g. as a screening call before the technical exercise. I instinctively prefer to do the call first, because it's shorter than the exercise and seems nice to talk to someone properly before giving them something substantial to do. However, the technical exercise turned out to be a much stronger filter than the call, and can be done flexibly rather than in a particular slot- so I worked out that I would waste less candidate time total if I did it the other way round (_so long as_ I keep the number of people doing the exercise down).\n- for junior/mid and above applicant numbers are lower and technical standards are higher, so there is still a screening call before the technical exercise. Later, I started to add a separate culture-fit call as a final stage - the company I worked for was quite opinionated about the culture they wanted, and more senior people in a small team have a lot of leverage on that.\n\nPost offer:\n- with that many candidates, I don't automatically give feedback to every failed applicant, but I do make clear that anyone who asks for it will receive it.

While you might say this was \u201ctuning\u201d you ended up incorporating a ton of bias due to features of the model either being multi-collinear or it was missing a confounder. \n\nThe same happens in causal models and the best way to handle this is to keep a consistent framework of how you set up your problem, DAG, select features, and experiments.

I'm trying to find a probability book that meets the following criteria:\n- Motivates different concepts and does not just show definition-proof-definition-proof\n- Is complete in that it covers all the fundamentals of probability\n- Is not overtly pro/anti bayesian\n- Suitable for a data science professional with a mathematics undergrad but hasn't studied in several years\n- Is suitable for self-study (problem solutions must be available in the book or online)\n\nI skimmed across Probability by Shiryaev but it was a bit too definition-proof for my liking and too abstract. I am looking for a dedicated probability book and will then move to a dedicated statistics reference book. Cheers",

You can view (but not download unfortunately) a copy at http://probabilitybook.net and see if the table of contents covers what you want, they cover a lot. Everything is motivated pretty well imo and the exercises and R simulations are chosen well.\n\nEdit: a portion of the problems have solutions available online, they say 250 of them. But I'd generally suggest being flexible on this, otherwise you're going to limit yourself a lot when it comes to choosing books. In this case, a lot of the ones without solutions are probably Googleable, and if you were a mathematics undergrad you hopefully developed a bit of a sixth sense for when you know what you're doing and when you don't.\n\nAnd P.S. it could not be any more different from Shiryaev's book lol.",

I thought they did (they used to, at least), so I might as well check.

When I first went to school I spent time as a data scientist which was equally as enjoyable for different reasons. \n\nWhat I\u2019ve seen in the real world is data science has difficulty in generating business value and can be disconnected from business drivers. While I don\u2019t disagree that work done by data science can be critical for some companies, I\u2019ve seen many companies get more value from analytics and experimentation. \n\nThere has been some discussion that the natural progression in the field is to go from data analyst to data scientist, but why? In companies I\u2019ve worked for DS and DA were paid on the same technical level while usually working more hours( this goes for DE as well), so the move can\u2019t be for the $. \n\nFor those in data science, why did you chose that route vs analytics. For those that transitioned from DA to DS, did you feel like you made the right choice? ",
        "comments": [
            "I looked at the salary guides. I don\u2019t know what companies value DS and DA the same, but I\u2019m glad they exist.\n\nData Analytics is a key piece to data science. It should go: Data minded business executives, upskilled IT team, strong data analytics, then data science.\n\nToo many firms like to try to do all 4 at once and then can\u2019t produce any value.",
            "Math and money",
            "The value obtained from a data analyst versus a data scientist entirely depends on the company and industry you work for. Generally speaking:\n\nData analysts are great for every day cost savings, product testing and improvements, customer optimisation etc. Most marketing and finance companies will get good value from a data analyst on site who is working across product, customer, and financial data. It\u2019s often an easy hire too because the results are quick and tangible to upper management. If your personal strengths lie in business acumen, data mining, and statistics this can be a lucrative and enjoyable career path. \n\nData scientists can be a little more difficult to evaluate from a profitability standpoint because their value and output has to be considered over a much longer timespan, usually. Their work is also often less tangible for hiring managers and C-Suite to comprehend, which can be an issue for data scientists when they join an environment with like this. It can become an uphill battle for the DS to prove their worth compared to their analytics counterparts who are delivering reports and spreadsheets daily. In my experience this is very rarely due to a lack of skill with the DS and rather a lack of understanding with management or a lack of clarity in terms of the project. I\u2019ve seen things turn sour for DS\u2019s in this situation who eventually move on to greener pastures. Generally if you\u2019re stronger in computer science than you are in business acumen, I\u2019d say a DS role is better suited to you than a DA role. But I think data scientists have to be far more selective about where they choose to work due to the reasons above. However DS\u2019s can often command a higher wage. \n\nSo there\u2019s pros and cons to both routes and although there is overlap in skill set, I\u2019ve found there is a distinction in personality types and strengths when it comes to DA\u2019s versus DS\u2019s.  \n\nWorth noting that (in the UK anyway) it\u2019s much easier to claim R&D tax rebates on a data scientist than it is a data analyst. This can be a very attractive feature when you consider that a large chunk of the DS\u2019s salary can be claimed back as a cash refund from HMRC, as well as anything the DS touches (software, hardware, cloud server costs, other members of the product team etc).",

She was a senior analytics consultant who'd been with a company for 25 years and was 100% remote BEFORE COVID.  She knew everything about a certain segment of databases in our system that was absolutely critical to the company, and she was the only person in the entire company that knew the systems that well.\n\nBasically, she'd made herself unfireable. If she ever got hit by a bus it would dramatically affect overall productivity for a few months at least.\n\nWhat made it even better was that she had been paying into the pension system that we have for the whole period, so when she retires she's going to get an amazing pension package in addition to her 401k. Nobody bothers her and throws a bunch of unrealistic tasks on her. She does her work and she answers questions for noobs like me when we need it to understand the systems that she was a master at.\n\nI spent some time talking to her during my lunch breaks and she's in a position where her home is almost paid off, her kids are out of school, and her husband's going to retire in about the same time she does.

And I love statistics/numbers, and I feel like I get to be somewhat creative. I will say, however, I'm in lots of Zoom meetings that should maybe be emails lol, but it's sometimes nice just to get a chance to talk to people since we're remote (I kind of feel like that's what the meetings are for).\n\nFinally, the pay and benefits are amazing. A lot of the time, I'm amazed by it lol (particularly since I came from a lower-paying, higher-workload and higher-stress field - clinical research - it's night and day).\n\nSo, how did I get into it? I'm doing my master's in DS and have a bachelor's degree in econometrics, but I also think the bulk of how I got the job was from doing projects and being able to show that I knew what I was doing via a portfolio/giving concrete examples of competency. (I mostly used Python/R, SQL, and Tableau. Also Jupyter notebooks, and Excel and PowerPoint are probably good to know, etc.)",

My university offers a cool degree called Finance + Data Science and I\u2019m trying to apply into it because I\u2019m interested in both subjects, and I have a strong quantitative background. I really want to master programming languages for DS like python, R, etc and other resources like Tableau. I\u2019m also pretty good at statistics and I\u2019d say I definitely like it too. Is it okay for math to only go up to calc 2 and linear algebra? Ik data science is a quantitative field but doesn\u2019t always need to be an expert on math? If I need calc 3, I\u2019ll take it at CC. \n\nAlso for remote jobs, that\u2019s cool with the flexibility. Do you think there are some jobs in the field that may be a hybrid, where you can do some work at home and also go in person? Sounds like a dream job. I wouldn\u2019t wanna be all at home because I might go crazy inside all day, but the flexibility would be nice and idk if I\u2019d wanna commute every single day 5 days a week.\n\nBtw, what is your workweek in hours? Id want a job that works 40 hours to give good life balance . In terms of getting started with your career, I assume it\u2019s generally normal to work 40 hours and not try to overwork like 50-60 to \u201cget ahead\u201d in your career.\n\nAlso, since you mentioned you had a degree in econometrics, is your job actually related to it or are you just using your masters in DS (and obviously the knowledge with statistics learned in econometrics)? Like are you doing data science within the field of economics? \nAnd can you give a rundown of the kinds of projects and such you may need to do as a data scientist? Do you often work alone or with other people?\n\nAnd did you know how to code during undergrad or did you learn all of it during your masters? Lastly, I think going to zooms and getting emails is alright but are u in those meetings to present your findings or what are they for?\n\nI know that people tend to jump from career to career to gain more experience, but it sounds like you love your job. Would you be willing to stay for many years and if not, why not?\n\nLastly, can you expand on what kinds of projects you would do for data science?

What could be good reasons to learn it for a data scientist?\n",
        "comments": [
            "Honestly, the functional style works super well for data science & data engineering. Max Beauchemin wrote a great post about this: [https://maximebeauchemin.medium.com/functional-data-engineering-a-modern-paradigm-for-batch-data-processing-2327ec32c42a](https://maximebeauchemin.medium.com/functional-data-engineering-a-modern-paradigm-for-batch-data-processing-2327ec32c42a)\n\nFrom my POV, here are the benefits of learning OOP:\n\n* **Many data science libraries** in Python and Java expose functionality using OOP interface. You have to create objects and run methods on them. Some examples:\n   * From Synthetic Data Vault: [https://docs.sdv.dev/sdv/single-table-data/modeling/synthesizers/gaussiancopulasynthesizer](https://docs.sdv.dev/sdv/single-table-data/modeling/synthesizers/gaussiancopulasynthesizer)\n   * From PyTorch: [https://vaibhavsingal1.medium.com/pytorch-advanced-concepts-part-1-inheritance-71bb21795291](https://vaibhavsingal1.medium.com/pytorch-advanced-concepts-part-1-inheritance-71bb21795291)\n* You sometimes have to **integrate your work** with the work of other software engineers. Most mobile & web software is written in OOP languages so being able to work with them helps you differentiate & stand out as a data scientist\n* Learning new things is **fun and rewarding** for it's own sake. You learn new mental models and can speak to more people. Data science at most places is about influencing business or organization decisions with data, visualizations, and rhetoric.",
            "Once you go beyond the simplest of ML applications, code complexity goes up very rapidly. In my experience, as soon as you need the model to interact with the outside world you need to start thinking about many different moving parts (DBs, APIs, data checks, corner cases,...). OOP is a good tool to keep your code from mutating quickly into an unmaintainable mess.",
            "I literally just had an entire OOP interview for a staff DS role. So even if you don't care about productionizing your code, maybe getting a job is a good enough reason to learn it?",
            "I think functional is misnomer and what you really mean is procedural programming.\n\nfunctional (as in scala/haskell), using functions as objects  is just as good as OOP for large scale, procedural programming not.",
            "Consider the following:\n\n```\nclass Document():\n   def init(self, link_to_file):\n      self.type = detect_file_type(link)\n      self.name = str(link_to_file)\n      self.content = extract_file_content(link)\n```\nYou can have separate file objects, each with their own properties. Toss them all into a list, and iterate over them.\n\n```\nfor doc in document_list:\n   If doc.type == \"pdf\":\n      print(doc.name)\n```\nNow you can print the names of only the documents that are PDF's, without needing to construct separate lists for your document types.\n\nThis is obviously only scratching the surface of OOP, but I think it's one of the easiest examples for a data scientist who isn't well versed in OOP to see the advantages of it.\n\nYou can containerize 100% of the object-related code. It's extremely nifty."

        "content": "So I want to start out by saying that AI is an incredibly useful, arguably fundamental tool.  LLMs have an amazing potential to aid in productivity, I really feel that AI is going to make personalized healthcare a possibility and there are of course many as of yet undiscovered applications.  We need AI in our lives and it can make the world a better place.\n\nBut the scale of data required to train these things necessitates using publicly available data which no one can claim to have developed or collected themselves.  If a company has sales data and it trains AI on that data which they colected and organized, then yes they can claim this is an IP they themselves made and developed.  But we all know these models are of limited generalizability.  And when we think of training say an AI to predict which drug is going to treat a person cancer based on the genotyping of a tumor sample there is simply no way an private enterprise would be able to collect and collate the data needed for that sort of discovery.  It needs to be open access, you can commercialize certain aspects and applications I'm sure.  Like compounds discovered using the model, if you used it to develop those compounds.  But the core model needs to be not for profit and withholding that model past a certain point is harmful to society at large and unjust considering you didn't really build the thing yourself.\n\nLooking forward to counter arguments, refinement of my logic, and healthy discussion.  Be civil lets have a fun talk if you have any thoughts!\n\n**EDIT** ***I wanted to share something a very knowledgeable poster provided about what specific aspects of an LLM (or other advance ML) should be public and what should remain a companies IP.  It's very comprehensive and well thought through:***\n\n>I think the entire set of training data (technically I mean the entire dataset and not in the sense of training, validation, test, or any other subset used for calibration) should be made available, even what is created in-house. I think it's very important that everyone at least have the same access to the data. My reasoning for that is because it is extremely important to ensure that dataset is not biased, which would take a lot of people with a lot of different perspectives to figure out. It also removes the major barrier to entry so hopefully people would focus on innovation, instead of obtaining data. That's it though. Everything else is the spawn of creativity and compute resources and opening them would serve no purpose beyond allowing replication of the product.  \n>  \n>The parameter weights are the product of the compute time, so once that expense gets high enough, IMO, it really seems like theft to force them to give it away. It would remove the incentive for anyone else to spend more time making a better product. The structure of the models, the order the functions are called, even the way the training data is applied can all make a big difference in performance. So I see that as a creative work requiring a lot of effort which also shouldn't be given away. If the models are only using techniques developed in academia, then anyone can learn those regardless of whether or not any specific company makes their models public (spoiler: they aren't).  \n>  \n>I would also be supportive of making it a requirement to provide no-cost API access for watchdogs or organizations to ensure an unbiased final model. Like an audit of the final product.\n\n&#x200B;",

I doubt anyone would try to `SELECT *` it into a dataframe, though.\n\nA real-world example: We create a performance table (my domain is finance) that, if allowed to, would grow to tens of trillions of rows. Simply a matter of creating enough scenarios that are allowed to map many-to-many when it comes to measurement periods (i.e., start on Jan 1st., stop at Jan 2nd, and stop at Jan 3rd. etc., with different calculations for each).\n\nYou will almost always pick a couple partitions to pull data from.

But oftentimes depending on the problem space it\u2019s nontrivial figuring out when and how to draw those samples so as to leverage the data properly/effectively; hence data scientists. \n\nThe general pattern of solving business problems with data this large is mostly the same, it just is more complicated and relies on more high-powered tooling (e.g. data sitting compressed columnar formats in cloud storage, big compute clusters for analyzing that data, aggregating it and depositing the downsampled forms it somewhere else, etc). \n\nSource: I dealt with datasets of this size for several years as an applied researcher at AWS.",

        "content": "Okay, so I'm in need of some career advice, because honestly I'm at a point where I don't really know how to proceed in the future.\n\nFor some background info:\n- I've completed my Bachelor's degree in Computer Science (3 years degree), took a year of pause (during that time I just focused on work), and at the moment I'm in my first year (out of 2) of my Masters's degree in Data Science.\n\n- As for work experience, I started working during my second year of Bachelor's as a Software Engineer. I've completed two internships, and I've been a Junior Software Engineer for more than a year and a half (currently I'm still working, trying to manage both my job and the university lectures and assignments in parallel). The languages/frameworks that I've worked with the most are Python - Django/FatsAPI, Ruby - Ruby on Rails, TypeScript - React (even if my perspective for this field is that I shouldn't be fixed on just some languages/standards, as the industry is evolving at such a rate, that from a month to the other we might find a new tool that's 100 times more efficient).\n\n- Up until recently I didn't ever interact that much with the concepts of Machine Learning, but since starting the Data Science degree I've realised that I like this field a lot and I take every Uni project as a challenge that I love solving.\n\nNow let's get to the actual issue at hand: in the next few months I would like to look for another workplace, since I've realized that the environment that I'm currently in is affecting me negatively and unfortunately I don't consider that this is a place where I can grow (both as an employee/software engineer as well as a person in general). If you'd like more info about the reasons, I can edit this post and add them, but I don't want to make this too long.\n\nAt this point, I don't really know what path to take: continue with the Software Engineering career or switch to Data Science / ML / NLP?\n\nI'm asking this from 2 distinct perspectives:\n1. which one of the two is better for my future? I've been reading different posts lately about some data scientists / ml engineers saying that this field is really volatile and a lot of companies switch strategies from one day to another and many find themselves unemployed out of the blue, besides the fact that some people say that there are already too many data scientists / ml engineers for the few jobs required. But thinking about all of the advances in AI that have been happening lately, I was under the impression that this field is going to thrive in the future.\n2. I have always believed that salaries in both fields are good, but as a data scientist / ml engineer you can reach a higher max salary compared to what the max salary of a software engineer can be (even if I've also read posts that stated the contrary).\n\nIf I want to be completely honest, I think that I already have the answer, since I like a lot what I'm studying and everything related to this field is just sooo captivating. \n\nBut my problem right now is that I've ve been able to get to a point where I'm competent enough as a software engineer to make enough money to support myself, so finding another job in the same field would be easier. Since my parents are not helping me financially anymore, I don't think I would be able to get by with the paycheck of an intern (around 800 Euros/month where I live), if I were to switch fields.\nAnd I don't think anyone would take me in this field for anything more than an internship, because I'm aware of the fact that I do not have enough experience in Machine Learning and Statistics for any other role.\n\nAs for some additional information that might be helpful, I'm in my early twenties and I live in Eastern Europe, where prices are not as high as in other places, but it's still not easy to get by by yourself.\nI've been also looking around for various opportunities in other countries in this field, in order to be able to work remotely or maybe do an internship there, but I haven't been able to find much.\n\nPS: I know that a lot of people might say that I'm young and that this is the best time to take risks, but going to an intern's salary would just expose me to the risk of being homeless, and that's not such a good option :D\n\nPS 2.0: I have also mentioned the NLP sector because it sparked my interest and I\u2019ve been taking some extra classes in order to gain some more knowledge about it.\n\nTLDR: which is the best career option between Software Engineering and Data Science/ML/NLP?",

Imagine you have a team of 5 DSs: 2 DS1, 2 DS2, and 1 DS3, where DSX is a Data Scientist 1-4. What is your measure of success - promotions, completed projects, revenue contribution,etc? How do DSX become DSX+1?\n\nSome of my thoughts:\n\n1. As a manager, I can support my DSs by **NOT** micromanaging.  I will track your project and encourage model reviews, code reviews and present final outputs to the team. All necessary skills of a DS.\n\n2. I can ensure my DSs have the skills to mange a project. A DS1 would see many touch points with the manager(me) or a DS3-4 on projects to ensure success, a DS2 less, and DS3 probably none. This in fact is my basis for promotion - shows level of competency on managing projects and deliverables. \n\n3. There can also be project based performance promotion, that is, DS possibly lacking project managing skills but tackles difficult projects and delivers top notch work consistently. \n\n4. The bigger issue is about personal development(PD).  How do managers balance PD against available projects? The DSs may want to gain experience in applying AI or unstructured learning , GPGPU models, specific toolsets like Vertex AI, NLP etc. Your team\u2019s project assignments  may not see this diverse a set of projects. When a project becomes available I balance availability against skill set in order to complete the projects based on delivery times and quarterly goals because these are the measures of success for my team. Typically I fill the void with targeted training courses and allocate time to PD. \n\n5. Some managers think PD is solely the DS\u2019s responsibility. Thoughts?\n\n6.

Also, make sure it's in writing and they get a copy.\n\nAs for PD, see if you can get your company to spring for Coursera or Udemy Enterprise. Start off by setting a list of courses and enforce setting time aside for training. I would say something along the lines of, \"Unless I deem it an emergency, my people get at least an hour a day for will development.\" If I make it a mandatory thing for work, I'm going to make it pay off the work day.\n\nAs for job description, I would work with your boss to define the roles and give them to HR.

            "It depends a lot on the profile, but the most common issues are around engaging with the rest of the company, so a lot of personal development is about learning how to recognize and **unblock situations**: no data, inconsistent data, stakeholder doesn\u2019t want to be data-driven, goals unclear, data is messy, unclear responsibility, no warning when things go bad so their rot, executives are not aligned\u2026 You both manage as a manager as a delegating project lead.\n\nA critical aspect of that that I haven\u2019t seen many people mention is **debriefing after meetings**: explain why you intervened when you did and why you didn\u2019t even when you noticed a problem; that serves preparation for the next meeting. If you ask before the first meeting ever, \u201cWhat do you think that stakeholder's main concern will be?\u201d it often falls flat with junior members; if, after the first meeting, you establish, \u201cI thought his main concern would be timelines, which is why I talked about Agile project, but he seemed more concerned about his team budget once we automate their work\u2014did you feel that too?\u201d then you can ask \u201cDo you think he\u2019s still concerned about automation?\u201d and discuss strategies around it.\n\nIn some companies or some contexts, a critical skill is making sure, one by one, everyone is **aligned** before the meeting\u2014it takes longer to train people to recognize when. But if that\u2019s not where you are or where the DS wants to go, you can skip that and talk about building good data products: accessible, legible, straightforward, trustworthy, etc.\n\nSometimes, you get someone from another part of the business. They go along great with their previous team, so the training is more about **technical skills** and working in ways that let the rest of the team follow and support: documented analysis, modular, commented, re-usable code, unit tests, integration tests, establishing ownership, and data contracts.\n\nFor that part, I typically try to leverage software engineers in the company: even when they don\u2019t know Python (they do) or Pandas (some do), they can tell by smell what is good code, good code-writing loops (TDD) and having opportunities to coach is good. It also helps point DS towards **learning to learn** from others.\n\nNothing against Coursera or Udacity; I\u2019ve green-lit a lot of budget for that, and it\u2019s proven ineffective. Most of the time, the DS had no time or no motivation; the classes were too simple or too abstract. In the rare cases where someone (typically a less technical member trying to up-skill to MLE) actually went through the effort, prioritizing the right project over fighting fires (requiring more basic skills and context knowledge) has proven impossible.\n\nThat was generally my fault and not a great example of leadership. \u201cI want to go to ML\u201d tends to come after asking for promotions for several cycles, being clearly stuck, and exploring other options; at that point, morale is low. The demotivation lets fester some data fires. I come along late in that process and don\u2019t come in with the influence to push back on said fires. I don\u2019t know that learning that your career can get stuck is something your manager should do."

Much of machine learning is done on a small scale and is not indended to do any more than provide a one time insight. Obviously this varies by employer, but that's the point, this class has to cater to everyone.\n\nYour professor certainly has their biases, but so do you, and I wouldn't say internships gives you great insight into what all firms are doing in different industries.",

It's a (introductory, i think) course, not a conference, and while the stuff feels outdated, they are important if you want to understand the arguments and logic of the SOTA (what was improved, what issues are targeted, what can be improved and what's not improvable...). I think if you'd just skipped to the SOTA stuff you would take a ton of things for granted and memorized them like axioms. At this point it depends on the lecturer's goal -- do they want to teach you commands and names to learn, or give you a broader education that would allow you to proceed with the SOTA methods individually in the future.",
            "Other people have mentioned that it largely depends on the level of courses. \n\nEven at graduate level courses like this [one](https://courses.cs.washington.edu/courses/cse546/), many courses are about laying down foundation for future study and research. It's not about the methods or tools it self but the principle behind it. That's why I expect any decent programs and classes have heavy emphasis on topics linear regression etc.  Many of the state of the art methods are natural evolution of the basics. The college should focus on teaching the basics so that the students can learn new methods and concepts on their own later. \n\nA good instructor will emphasize on the basics and touch on how things evolves. For Ph.D. students, the department often have those reading classes which just let students read the newest paper and present.\n\nIt sounds that you are more interested in a class which just allows to start using tools right away. Not saying it's not important, but different classes have different emphasis.",
            "It probably varies a lot by field, by department, even by professor, whether they make any effort at all regarding what they teach to keep up to date or industry- relevant. I could imagine somebody teaching the same syllabus year after year without updating it. They have tenure, after all. Actually, this is partly the endless debate about education vs training. What they should be doing is giving people a firm foundation in the subject. On the job training should be done on the job. Also don\u2019t forget accreditation. In STEM, the accrediting bodies dictate much of the curriculum, and they aren\u2019t always up to date either. For example, the Chem E curriculum seems to be almost exactly what it was when I was an undergraduate nearly half a century ago."

I don\u2019t like not being able to see the result of coding as I go along, like I would in R or even Python. Not to mention, it doesn\u2019t run on Mac systems, and their free university software (that I\u2019ve been using) does not allow you to copy and paste.

            "SAS has been around for a long time.  It was developed in the 70s on the mainframe.  The Language with PROC and DATA step look like it.\n\nMany of us older folks did SAS back in the day.  I did SAS in school on the mainframe in the 1980s and on unix systems at work in the 1990s - 2010s, in addition to doing a bunch of other different stuff.\n\nDoesn't mean we like it when we've used it for so long.  But here's what some people don't know.  SAS is used more for data movement and transformations, along with putting together 'reports' than it is used for analytics.  Back in the mainframe days, a lot of business apps were written in COBOL.  I'm one of those culprits.  But for non-programmers, SAS was a 4GL that was much easier to code than COBOL.\n\nSAS DATA STEP let you move files from one spot to another in a few lines of code.  It let you do transformations and formatting with a few more lines of code.  So there is a lot of SAS from the 1980s -2000s that are not doing analytics at all.  They are doing reporting.  SAS is still around in these installations because no one wants to rewrite that code.\n\nSAS/Access software on \\*nix systems is pretty nifty.  If you want to get a pile of data on that Oracle source system to your data warehouse system that might be in Teradata or some other parallel database, SAS/Access with DATA STEP in 3 lines of code will get it moved from one system to another.  With 5-6 lines of code you can optimize it so it takes advantage of the database vendors parallel capabilities.  This gets used a ton in places I've been.  Again, no analytic work here.  Just data movement.  To do some of this in Python or R is more code, or not very efficient.\n\nAll the above is not to praise SAS.  I prefer python libraries to do analytic work.  Have for many years.  But there are a lot of installations with decades of processes that ensure SAS is not going away anytime soon.\n\nSAS has tried to modernize and has made a little bit of progress in that area, but not much in my opinion.  For most folks Python / R will be a better fit than SAS nowadays.  I left my previous company after doing SAS off and on for over 15 years, and have not touched it at all where I am now.\n\nOne thing good about SAS is the support.  SAS is expensive and those that say it's expensive probably have not used SAS support very much.  I used it all the time.  I've had a coworker in the past have a Ph.D. algorithm expert from SAS on the line and emails with my coworker working through a problem with her.  SAS support, in my experience has been top notch.  I spent a lot of time on the SAS campus with my previous company.  We were partnering with them on some things.  I'd go say hello to the support folks on campus to put a face to a name.  \n\nOne thing about SAS, is they give their folks fantastic work conditions on the SAS campus.  Pretty much everyone, even the support folks, have their own private office with a door.  And these offices are well equipped.  I'm thinking that's where some of that money that you are paying to SAS goes.  Work life balance on the SAS campus seemed pretty good compared to the company I worked for at the time.  40 hours per week and done.\n\nAll that being said, I don't use SAS anymore.  I'm using Snowflake, DBT, Fivetran, Python stat/ML libraries and having a good time with that.\n\nSorry for long comment, but wanted to give my $0.02 on my experience with SAS.",
            "The main benefit of SAS is it can be used in highly regulated industries, and is even designed to do so. They (SAS) have a ton of people that write really good documentation for all their functions/programs so you know exactly what it is doing and how it is doing it. That is why many pharma, medical, and insurance companies use it, which has more regulation than a tech start-up. Literally, everything in SAS has been documented, tested, and thoroughly explained documentation written for anything you can do in it.",
            "If your company is paying for it, then they should pay for it to be properly deployed, and pay for the training that will teach you how to be a more efficient SAS programmer. \n\nI\u2019ve never used it in a mode where it was logging me out, sounds like a low cost web-based demonstration version?",
            "One reason to like SAS compared to other approaches is that SAS basically doesn't have memory limitations for large datasets. I know some countries censuses run SAS because the read in and data manipulation are essentially line by line."

        "content": "I have a background in medical research. I'm getting confused with data science terminology. Is causal inference the same in medical research and data science? So you do eg an RCT to determine treatment effect then Treatment effect = (Outcome under E) minus (Outcome under C)?\n\nOr in data science I guess it's A/B testing and measuring the effect when people are randomised to A or B. How do you use it?\n\nWhen I first heard of it I thought it was a way of determining a causative relationship when looking at correlation and teasing out confounders but I think you'd still need to do an RCT to prove the relationship, otherwise there's still the risk of reverse causality or confounders.",
        "comments": [
            "Causal inference is a really big field with tons of techniques with most of them (with the exception of RCTs) suffering from the same pitfall, they\u2019re very sensitive to the technique you are using. Different techniques will you give you different results. Oftentimes what we do in my role is basically look at a bunch of techniques and if they all show the same directional result we call it a win. I\u2019ll talk about some of the techniques I use in my own role. \n\nThe most common techniques I use at my job are instrumental variables and propensity score matching. \n\nOften times in an RCT, you might tease out a small effect between your control or treated group (like percentage of people signing up for a product, or spend when exposed to a treatment with the control being no marketing), but what you\u2019re really interested in is a further down the funnel metric scaled by the people that actually respond to the offer. In this case you need to use instrument variables to get the benefit from the group of people that responded to the offer using the RCT as your instrument.\n\nI also use propensity score matching to tease out causality for customers we have a lot of data for (for example, customers that may self select into some feature of a product where we can\u2019t design an RCT). This suffers from the massive problem of omitted variable bias but it\u2019s the only approach we have. You can do sensitivity analyses to understand how sensitive your analysis is to confounders but multiple different techniques will give you different answers.\n\nSome of my colleagues do counterfactual analysis where we use time series analysis or synthetic controls to predict what the value would have been, and then use the delta between the actual and prediction to identify the impact of a treatment (this is relevant for geographic testing where you can\u2019t really randomize the units, just balance them on pre period kpis).\n\nThe best way to get familiar is probably Matheus facures causal inference textbook online. It\u2019s a great resource and I used it to get up to speed. Another good book I\u2019m currently working through is the book of why by Judea Pearl.",
            "You\u2019re on the right track. There are tiers to causal inference:\n\nTier 1: Meta analyses of RCT (A/B test) results, and one off A/B tests\n\nTier 2: Using observational data to investigate the impact of policy changes (quasi experiments); causal graphs and causal discovery can fit into this as well but I\u2019d call it tier 2b.\n\nTier 3: drawing conclusions from descriptive data\n\nA lot of what people mean when they say causal inference is actually tier 2: analysing quasi-experiments using a host of econometric and ML techniques. A lot of the methods in tier 2 can also be used to estimate the effects of A/B tests, and often are employed for more complex experiments",
            "There are some  modelling techniques from econometrics that, in theory, can be used to effectively control for confounders in observational data. Examples are difference-in-differences, instrumental variables or regression discontinuities. Usually when people talk about causal inference this is what they mean.\n\nAs an econometrician in data science, I found most of them too impractical to be used in my job. I have some friends who run quasi-experiments around cutoffs in online games, but this is about the extend of what I have seen it being used in industry.",
            "In causal inference world, RCT just means you know the treatment assignment mechanism and that the potential outcomes are independent of that mechanism. In observational data, there may or may not be conditional independence. Causal inference and the language of potential outcomes allows us to talk about causality more generally, and not be limited to only RCTs.",
            "One aspect of causal inference I learned only recently is that you can't reliably identify confounder variables by running correlation tests between treatment, outcome, and covariates. You could be ignoring alternative relationships that produce the same correlation statistics.\n\nIt's preferable to decide a priori which variables to include in your model as confounders using your subject area expertise. Even better is draw a causal diagram."

My understanding of the Data Science work has evolved a lot over the years. Having a team that only does Data Science leads to the approach of - we have a tool (Data Science), how do we use it? That is starting from the solution, as opposed to starting with a business problem. Therefore I am a big proponent of cross-functional teams that can build data products E2E and don't always need Data Science (but it should be an option) in which case the Data Scientist can do research that doesn't block the critical path to a first product.

There is one small team of people with \"data scientist\" titles in the whole org but they are in a separate silo from me. \n\nGenerally I am tossed tasks that don't make a whole lot of sense: for example comparing forecast accuracy for the exact same models between a no-code out of the box forecaster like SAP IBP with Python models that a contractor they hired built. Other times I will get requests so vague like \"build us a chatbot\". I have always hounded them with questions and shared my opinions on these asks, but basically get told to shut up and go away each time.  \n\nNow they have cut what I can only assume is a few million dollar check with a large consulting company to build out a demand and inventory forecasting model. The thing is, they just launched an out-of-the-box SAP solution less than 2 years ago which does exactly that: inventory and demand forecasting. I can't imagine that project was less than a few million as well. \n\nIn all of this, no one can ever really articulate to me why we are doing this or what specifically they are trying to improve. It seems like they don't even realize the consultants will likely build a very similar model to SAP. \n\nAre most companies like this? Only some? It has been very stressful for me, as 4 people have also been let go from my team within the year I've worked here. It seems like they have no vision or clue what they are doing.",

I think the operational processes and the IT capabilities needed to support them got too complex for the business or IT folks to understand, then DS was thrown into the mix as a new role without a clear charter nor ownership of any business processes or systems.\n\nShort of looking for a different job, my best advice is to take everything the managers say with a huge grain of salt, try to ignore the unhinged ideas they throw at you, and instead get to know some of the people doing the actual day-to-day work, learn their business processes, draw a flowchart, and try to figure out where there are specific tasks or decisions you can help automate. Then when you have a successful project doing this, tell everyone about it, and try to use it to make your own manager and theirs look good.",

            "A few reasons for so many interviews. \n\n* Everyone you speak with is a potential stakeholder (order giver) and wants to assess your willingness to create and manage deliverables. \n* Having more people involved gives the appearance of a democratic process where everyone has input and decision-making authority.\n* The highest ranking person you speak with likely controls the budget for the position and wants to \"kick the tires\" before deciding",
            "Two reasons why you're seeing this:\n\n**This is how it's always been done**, and it's how it's still done in most teams/functions that are older. I think it has generally been anchored on a couple of ideas. \n\nFirstly, that leaders set and enforce the team culture, and keeping them in the loop allows them to have a present voice  in ensuring that culture is maintained. That sounds good on paper, but in practice it tends to give too much weight to people who are good at shmoozing important people. \n\nSecondly, that a Director/VP/etc. got there by being really good at the job that they're not hiring for at some stage. Which used to often be somewhat true, but with DS leadership often not being careers DSs themselves, this is really, really not true.\n\n**There are some people who believe that an optimal hiring philosophy is that your bar should always be high.** One way I've heard  it phrased is that every person in an interview process should be looking for reasons to say \"no\" to a candidate. If no one can, then you hire them. \n\nNow, this isn't just randos with opinions - I've heard this from people who I very much respect. So there may be something to it - i.e., making the application process easier for the candidate comes at a higher risk of hiring someone who isn't very good, which is one of the most expensive mistakes you can make as a hiring manager.\n\nPersonally, I agree with you - I think  that generally speaking there isn't a ton of value in including people in the interview process who are more than 2 levels removed from the role they're hiring for. So if I am hiring for a role, I like to have myself, my boss, and 2 peers interview them. If one of my directs was hiring someone, I'd like to have them, myself, and two of my skip reports interview them.",
            "A couple things:  \n\n\nFirstly, if the execs are rude or aloof then I'd consider it a mercy to discover that before you accept a job working for them. That's great to learn, and lucky for you, you aren't stuck with bad leaders.\n\nSecondly, why do you get thrown off in these interviews? What is it that makes it go poorly? Work on improving those conversations and it sounds like you'll solve the last piece of the puzzle to landing a new role.",
            "Depends on the size of the company. That said, a lot of interview process is often unnecessary.",
            "It depends. I\u2019ve interviewed at startups where the CEO was in the loop. And I\u2019ve interviewed at FAANG companies where HM is as high up as it goes.\n\nFor smaller companies it\u2019s more common to have more levels involved as the senior leaders may still want to be personally involved in all hiring. But as the companies get larger, this doesn\u2019t scale. So a CEO may personally hire everyone at a 10 person startup, but probably only managers at 100 person company, and probably only senior leaders at a 1,000 person company.\n\nAnother factor is the HM\u2019s experience. If they are new to the role/company then their manager may want to be more involved until the HM\u2019s manager is comfortable with the HM\u2019s decision making. For example a manager on my team is making their first hire (an IC analyst), and I\u2019m involved as it\u2019s their first time going through the process.\n\nIn general though, 2 levels up is unusual. For my hiring decisions my boss doesn\u2019t even know until our quarterly headcount report. I can\u2019t imagine his boss would care at all."

One phone costs $500 and another costs $700. They have very similar features, but the more expensive one brags it used advanced ml/ai. If you're anything like me, my first question would be ok what's the ml/ai do, and is what it does worth $200. And maybe what it does is worth it. Maybe the phone uses ml/ai to optimize battery usage and has double the battery life of the cheaper phone. In that case I might get it, but the reason has to do with the longer battery life not the cutting edge method. The cutting edge stuff is the tool not the product.

And solving problem formulations where a medium sized error is just fine is much easier than solving problems where errors can't be tolerated.\n\nViability: Solving problems that derive their value from big cash streams makes you more money than making perfect bleeding edge solutions for small cash streams.",
            "Once a company has a mature, automated process to handle fundamental analytics methods, and the company is actually using those data points as their 'baseline' for strategy/sales/business, then the incremental operation would be the cutting edge/ML capabilities. From my standpoint, I think your team's job is to help people reach that baseline point, and from there as customers improve their process the ML/bleeding edge methods of today will eventually be used.\n\nThis is the reality not only for Analytics, but also for Finance and Accounting when Big 5s are called to clean, audit, and review the accounts and books of a company to get them up to speed and up-to standard.",

There might be niche teams within the company doing state-of-the-art R&D, but most teams focus on established best practices, mainly because they're proven, understood, and makes everyone comfortable.\n\nYou get no points using state-of-the-art techniques, even if it shows some improvement, if the client and stakeholders (including your teammates) don't understand nor feel comfortable with them. Especially as a consultancy, the main value you deliver to clients is stability, easy-to-understand, easy-to-support, and well-established and proven practices. You usually can't get this with SOTA methods unless you dump a lot of money into it. Profit-wise, not worth it. \"Innovation\" is just a buzzword to appeal to investors and look cool."

        "content": "Apologies in advance for the ramble. I\u2019m just really in need of some objective advice right now.\n\nSo far I consider myself a moderate success story: With zero relevant education or experience, in my 30s I taught myself math, stats, and coding, then scored a job as a junior machine learning research engineer. In this job I analyze large data sets, run deep learning experiments in the cloud using large pre-trained models, and write back end code to serve these models for inference in operational products. My work is a mixture of ML research and MLOps. I\u2019ve trained thousands of models, written tens (maybe low hundreds?) of thousands of lines of code, and even been listed on a couple papers and one patent. As a junior engineer I\u2019m mostly told what to do, but I have significant freedom to decide how best to do it. This was exactly my goal when I first embarked on my improbable journey.\n\nI\u2019ve been in this role for 2.5 years now. I\u2019ve learned so much and really loved it. But lately the sheen has worn off, and dissatisfaction has started to creep in. Basically I just need more money to support my family, and this job isn\u2019t going to deliver it fast enough.\n\nSo now I feel significant pressure to find my second MLE job, but everything about that prospect terrifies me. My current job is all I\u2019ve ever known in tech, and I\u2019m just not experienced enough to get a feel for how competitive I\u2019ll be in the market. I still feel weak compared to many colleagues, but maybe it\u2019s just imposter syndrome. Also, my ML subfield (NLP) is moving so fast these days that the moment you learn something new it\u2019s already out of date, making it impossible to ascertain how comprehensive or current my skill set actually is. So I just really don\u2019t know.\n\nAnyway, here is a grab bag of my skills and credentials, I guess:\n\n- Education\n\n    - Two MA degrees, one marginally relevant to NLP but not STEM/computational at all, so probably won\u2019t wow any engineering managers\n\n- Python\n\n    - Very proficient\n\n    - Have written tons of it, including packages, but almost all is internal/proprietary\n\n    - Familiar with most of the basic ML/data analysis libraries, and some familiarity with deep learning libraries like PyTorch and transformers (never used TensorFlow)\n\n- Linux\n\n    - Fairly proficient\n\n    - I use Bash and zsh everyday, both locally and on remote servers over ssh, writing and reading shell scripts with low-to-moderate complexity \n- SQL\n\n    - Basic proficiency\n\n    - I can compose simple SQL queries, and some moderately complex ones with Google\u2019s help, but that\u2019s about it. Not doing much with DBs these days.\n\n- Software development\n\n    - Fair amount of experience for 2.5 years, I think\n\n    - I\u2019ve worked with teams of other engineers and PhDs to to write the back ends of our ML-driven engines and software packages\n\n    - I work every day with Git, CI/CD, testing, conda, and OOP, basically all in Python\n\n    - We use the Agile framework. I fucking hate it, but anyway, I know the concepts and lingo\n\n- AWS\n\n    - Not certified, but familiar with the basic concepts and services. Never used any other cloud provider\n\n    - We do most of our experimentation on S3-backed EC2, but are starting to use the SageMaker ecosystem now\n\n- Math/stats\n\n    - Strong enough algebra, calculus, linear algebra, and statistics to understand deep learning techniques and read the occasional research paper\n\n    - No classes or grades or anything to prove this though. I just used Khan Academy for everything, so there\u2019s no real paper trail\n\nBeyond the above, I have started (though not finished) a handful of pet projects on GitHub and completed an absolute assload of MOOCs (I think I have like 26 Coursera certificates).\n\nThings I\u2019m still weak on include:\n\n- Networking\n\n    - As someone with a non-CS, non-STEM background, I have very few connections in the tech industry. Basically my network consists of my current coworkers and a few ex-coworkers who recently left\n\n- Front end\n\n    - Never built a website, dashboard, or GUI of any kind. If someone asked me to surface the outputs of a model to users, I\u2019d have almost no idea where to begin. I could probably figure it out, but it\u2019s not something I can currently\n\n    - For this reason I feel as far from full-stack as one can be\n\n- Data structures and algorithms\n\n    - This is something I never directly studied, but rather have just picked up the very basics as needed on the job. As such my knowledge is superficial, patchy, and incomplete at best\n\n    - I basically understand Big-O and the basic data structures. It\u2019s been sufficient for my current job, but that\u2019s it\n\n    - Have never done any LeetCode or similar\n\nEssentially my credentials boil down to \u201cSomeone else hired me as an MLE 2.5 years ago and hasn't fired me, so I can\u2019t be *completely* incompetent, right\u2026?\u201d Lol. That just doesn\u2019t seem very strong. If we used GitHub at work, such that hiring managers etc. could at least peruse what I\u2019ve done, that would be great, but we don\u2019t, so they can\u2019t. Meanwhile, many would-be applicants will surely have degrees, publicly accessible school projects, and GPAs to point to, or else have at least as much work experience as me if not more.\n\nSo ... am I ready to jump? How can I assess whether I\u2019m prepared, whether I\u2019ll be competitive at all, and in which areas I absolutely must improve? I guess I just need more confidence and assurance in order to take the next step. Any input much appreciated.",

That's not doing most of the resumes any justice. Even if it improves signal over an ATS. It's still an outrageous amount to achieve pretty mediocre results. \n\n- A trivial data question is slapped onto an application to cut off 70% of the applicants, to only those that want to write or ChatGPT their way to a quick answer (I highly doubt anyone even checks your response) after which a recruiter can spend more time reading each of the remaining.\n\nNone of these is going to give great signal, but the reality is, this isn't designed to give signal, it's designed to prevent a recruiter from drowning, even if imperfectly done.

Data Science does not have a well-defined career path and data scientists have a very fluid job description from company to company, industry to industry and even within companies on different teams. No tech sector experience is truly worthless.\n\nIf you don't stick it out, you need a damned good reason. Your school will not look kindly on it. During my undergrad a fellow classmate landed what was honestly a dream internship doing regression analyses. It taught her she shouldn't have been in the field because she had no interest, and eventually just dropped out. The company was so mad they severed ties with the school, and my classmate ended up dropping out. I think it was her, not the school, but she did a lot of damage. \n\nYou also owe it to your future self to stick it out. Shitty pay? I had three internships, only two were paid and it wasn't much.

It's very different, incredibly hard, will take over your life, probably get you into debt, and takes an entirely different skill set. For example I'd say that your actions so far seem very passive (scrape an email list, send a blanket letter out, come to reddit to ask for help). Maybe I'm being unfair, but my point is not to be mean but to highlight how sales people work very differently to how you have written yourself here.  \n\n\nSo the easier option might be to \"package\" your code into a product, and then see if someone like DataBricks will buy your code to optimise their systems that they then roll out to other companies and you get either a cut or an up-front fee for it.

I finally gave up a few years back when I realised there will always be things I don't know and my solutions will never be perfect. Currently I use my insecurities just to polish my solutions as much as possible and nothing more.Coming to your question around the advanced topics, I do have the knowledge and some experience building complex DL solutions. But I have very limited experience in deploying these. I also do not have any experience with pytorch (I grew up in the tf world).  There are many topics such as images, audio, causal modeling, time-series, optimisation problems, reinforcement learning etc where I have extremely limited understanding and I am not bothered about those. I spend time learning these based on the necessity.\n\nCurrently some of my reportees are using pytorch, so I am spending time to learn the fundamentals of it else I wouldn't know if their code follows the best practices of pytorch.Similarly, I stopped following every new variant of BERT or GPT architecture. I did read may be 10-15 papers related to transformers family, about 2-3 years back. So I get a sense of the incremental gains without reading the full paper. If they are relevant to my work, that's when I spend more time going deep.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nBasically, it boils down to:Being strong with the basics so that you can\n\n1. Make sense of new concepts in the related work\n2. And you know when you don't know something - so you can dig deeper when the time arrives\n\nIf I am lacking the basics that are required for my role, I keep learning those - but not the MOOCs and the content aimed towards the masses, instead I try to read the technical papers, or foundational material.\n\nMost of my day goes on in understanding competitive landscape, figuring out how ML can improve our product, then planning these in our OKRs, doing some POCs, reviewing codes, unblocking my reportees when they are stuck with something either by ideating or debugging etc. As you go up the career ladder, you are paid to identify what problems are worth solving and making others solve these, rather than you solving the problems\n\nAnd I heard even higher up its about identifying what's not worth solving - think CXOs who have competent VPs who always have problems they want to solve. Their goal is to cut down noise and keep the focus by using the people and other resources wisely. That's a problem hopefully for the future.",

I am a software/ML engineer in Python, R, and Rust and have some data science experience from a couple of years back. Furthermore, I did my undergrad in Econometrics and a graduate degree in Statistics, so I am very familiar with most concepts.

Back when was doing DS work, for most use cases using XGBoost was totally fine and received good enough results. This would have definitely been my go-to choice in 2019 to solve the challenge at hand. My question is: In general, is this still a good strategy, or should I have another go-to model?  \n\n\nDisclaimer: Yes, I am absolutely, 100% aware that different models and machine learning techniques serve different use cases. I have experience as an MLE, but I am not going to build a custom Net for this task given the small scope. I am just looking for something that should handle most reasonable use cases well enough.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nI appreciate any and all insights as well as general tips.

To say it was difficult would be an understatement, and it\u2019s not just the program itself that made it so, but two external factors which (I\u2019ll list below) made studying a challenge. \n\n\n\n1. WORK: If you have a hard job already, DON\u2019T combine it with a data science masters. You could literally breakdown completely due to stress. My school recommend working only 10 hours per week and I ignored the advice because I needed the money. I worked 20 hours per week doing menial jobs. At some point I thought I would actually drop dead due to stress. Keep in mind that 20 hours is still part time work. I strongly recommend working a maximum  10 hours per week or not working at all if you\u2019re prone to stress.   My classmates who worked full time during their masters had very poor grades (some even dropped out). \n\n\n\n2. Family and peer support:  I always thought of myself as a lone journeyman who took on the world without needing to speak to anyone. Uhh\u2026. Yeah that went out the window completely when things got heated during the program. Not seeing family in the flesh  affected my mental health. I noticed that people who took the program with their families  were a lot happier than those of us who didn\u2019t have any family around. Speaking to family, friends and classmates going through the same program really helped A LOT though. You really can\u2019t go through this program as a loner. Life would hit you on the face like a brick for every single day of your existence if you attempt to do so. \n\nThat\u2019s my 2 cents. AA\n\nEDIT: \nCourse Selection: Just remembered this but uhh course selection is REALLY IMPORTANT. I had done enough online courses on data science before my masters, to know that neural networks and deep learning is something you study ON YOUR OWN, and  NOT as part of an official course. If you\u2019re new to data science, pick the easiest courses for your masters. I saw enough people completely fail their courses (and subsequently the entire masters) because they wanted courses that sound trendy. Seriously that\u2019s the only reason they chose them.

Only take one class per semester, unless you know it's two easy courses. Otherwise, you'd be suffering like I did, getting only 6 hours of sleep on most nights because I was struggling to fit in both work and studying. And if you're doing it part time, it's gonna be a 3 year experience, so prepare yourself mentally to give up a fair amount of video games or socializing (you can do one or the other, but not both)",

        "content": "Hello everyone. As a data science manager, managing a team in a rather complex organizational structure, I find myself in a bit of fix. While I enjoy people management and helping solve non technical problems and suggesting methods in technical aspects for the team to solve, it also leaves me with little to no time to do any data science stuff as most of my days are filled in meetings, responding to emails, team strategy, finances etc. I am worried about my tag as a data scientist as I continue to be involved in the managerial path, forget anything leetcode level. I would massively fail there at this stage of my career. Most companies that are hiring seem to want people who excel at technical stuff while managing teams. While personally this seems impractical when implementing, I would still need to crack interviews that might be heavy on data science stack. \n\nSo the question is, how do I manage to keep my self updated on technical stuff when I barely have the time in my role? I could keep brushing some of my core data stuff in the time outside my work hours but learning continuously on the side is going to eat away into any of my personal time as well.

You can learn by letting them walk you through their solutions / code in detail.\n\nFurthermore, I use my position to connect with a broader group of people. Among which there are more data scientists and learning from them broadens my understanding. I might not be able to technically apply their approaches but if I had to, I'd know where to look tk get the job done.\n\nIMO there is no way around getting rusty but therefore you broaden your knowledge.\n\nAlso, companies have to decide what they want. Either they want a traditional manager like you are right now from what I understood or they want leaders that are heavily contributing indivually too. The latter is what I believe / have heard is the case at Amazon (happy to stand corrected). If your company wants that too, you should be allowed to limit the time you spend with the team. In that scenario team members learn to swim without much help or they don't and that's accepted as collateral demage by superiors. I personally prefer your company's model but that doesn't matter much.\n\nA last thing, I'd avoid to take on tasks if you have limited time. I did that (more our of business need than to up skill) and I learnt that I simply couldn't go as deep as required due to my other duties. Nobody won in these episodes. At least things didn't go as well as they could have if I'd approached it differently.\n\nHence, I started to work closer with team members where I helped them with the concept to get the project started and they'd do the coding work to bring it home. Everyone, including stakeholders, won in these episodes.\n\nSorry for the unstructured writing up but I hope it helps. I really appreciate your question and wanted to participate in some way.

If I give you a case study, can you tell me how you get the data, generate an analysis, and give me a conclusion?\n\nIf you're looking to build portfolio projects, I'd recommend picking a publicly available dataset. Analyze the data, generate insightful visualizations, tell me why they're important, what you learn from the data, and what you recommend.

Read on it a little, and make your goal to implement it in a couple of projects you're working on daily. Examine where it fits, where it doesn't, you'll see the downsides, maybe throw it away, but more likely find a nice spot where it fits nicely and you'll like it and use it for that at least. \n\nThen take another one. Would be great if you find the functionality interesting/curious. Or just a challenge.. \n\nOne step at a time! Don't seek to improve 10x within a week. Stop this exercise when it becomes boring, and get back to it again when you feel the inspiration. \n\nE.g., what works for me: my ETL monitor is bash based. My XML parser is Scala based. My feature engineering flow is Python based. Service control on Flask. The remainder is on R. \n\nWhenever I seek to polish or learn something for Scala/bash/flask, I sit down and upgrade certain parts of certain projects (there's always a backlog for everything). Sometimes the other way round, but it still bins me to a language I've preset for the project.\n\n>I just can't understand where improvement is needed, and if needed, how do I do that!\n\nSet up timed benchmarks and optimize towards quickest time. Maybe your tasks are simple and do not require clever optimizations, then try simulating a stress test. E.g., what's the max throughput a service VM can handle given fixed resources and 0 wait time. At what scale do your projects break (and stop scaling linearly), find the breakpoint and optimize there.",

Typically my thing is try to avoid nested loops when possible.\n\nUse iterative objects when possible instead of explicitly filtering, ie when you do groupbys in Polars or Pandas, you can get the name of the field and the filtered dataframe as a tuple for the groupby object.\n\nWhen it comes to libraries you've never heard of, read posts on subreddits like here or r/dataengineering and when they mention a technology you have never heard of, do a quick search to see what it's used for.

            "My 2c and this is oversimplifying things a lot but I think of the DS field in terms of 3 pillars. SWE, statistics/ML knowledge, ability to translate business problems into analytical problems we can solve. Very early in your career, you should have baseline proficiency/familiarity with all three. 2-4 YOE expect to spike in one of the three with curiosity/growth in another. By senior you should be looked at as a resource folks can go to with expertise in 2 of 3. Staff and beyond is a different story.\n\nWhichever you're weakest in, you will either need to seek help in order to help deliver impact or hope your company/team structure is organized in a way to plan and provide you that support. Not being strong in SWE unfortunately means in some companies/teams your lack of proficiency blocks you from getting your solutions deployed in a timely manner. Even minimal skills around coding best practices and code organization can make life easier for the SWE/MLE that helps get your work into production.\n\nWhile the PM seemed pretty curt, I'd say that you don't need experience as a SWE to build good coding habits and general understanding about life outside of notebooks. At the very least, familiarity with PEP8 makes sure your code is readable and consistent with coding standards. Knowing about conda environments, basic command line navigating, how to organize Python scripts and import functions from them, and version control via Github are just a handful of the pieces of a DS toolkit that will help you build good habits as you grow in your SWE proficiency.\n\nWhen interviewing for roles, I'd make sure to ask a lot about team structure and the other teams that the DS works with most closely. If you don't hear about software engineering, data engineering, etc support, it may be a poor team fit for you given the limitations. It doesn't mean there aren't teams where your skills and interests aren't valued, you just need to consider this if you really only want to live in notebooks forever.\n\nHappy to discuss more if you wanna shoot me a DM\n\nEdit: typos",

I have no idea whether using notebooks makes sense in your case. I don't know whether the infrastructure is set up for you to use anything else. If it isn't, I'd definitely say a DS should not be expected to do that alone.\n\nAlso, I suspect this PM probably doesn't have a great deal of understanding about exactly how much SWE skills to expect from DSs and their concern doesn't go much beyond having heard that \"notebooks = bad\". Really, if they want the code to be deployed through a repo and you're not in a position to do that, then both of you should be thinking about how to help make that happen. That they're not is a bit of a red flag on them tbh.\n\nUltimately, if you weren't hired for your SWE skills but the company want you to pick them up, there should be someone more experienced who can help you or some resource to help at least.",

        "score": 99,
        "comment counts": 28,
        "content": "  This article will explain how to use [Pipeline](https://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/compose.html?ref=dataleadsfuture.com) and [Transformers](https://scikit-learn.org/stable/data_transforms.html?ref=dataleadsfuture.com) correctly in Scikit-Learn (sklearn) projects to speed up and reuse our model training process.\n\nThis piece complements and clarifies the official documentation on Pipeline examples and some common misunderstandings.\n\nI hope that after reading this, you'll be able to use the Pipeline, an excellent design, to better complete your machine learning tasks.\n\n This article was originally published on my personal blog [Data Leads Future.](https://www.dataleadsfuture.com/ensuring-correct-use-of-transformers-in-scikit-learn-pipeline/) \n\n### Why use a Pipeline\n\nAs mentioned earlier, in a machine learning task, we often need to use various Transformers for data scaling and feature dimensionality reduction before training a model.\n\nThis presents several challenges:\n\n* **Code complexity**: For each use of a Transformer, we have to go through initialization, `fit_transform`, and `transform` steps. Missing one step during a transformation could derail the entire training process.\n* **Data leakage**: As we discussed, for each Transformer, we fit with train data and then transform both train and test data. We must avoid letting the distribution of the test data leak into the train data.\n* **Code reusability**: A machine learning model includes not only the trained Estimator for prediction but also the data preprocessing steps. Therefore, a machine learning task comprising Transformers and an Estimator should be atomic and indivisible.\n* **Hyperparameter tuning**: After setting up the steps of machine learning, we need to adjust hyperparameters to find the best combination of Transformer parameter values.\n\nScikit-Learn introduced the `Pipeline` module to solve these issues.\n\n### What is a Pipeline\n\nA `Pipeline` is a module in Scikit-Learn that implements the chain of responsibility design pattern.\n\nWhen creating a Pipeline, we use the `steps` parameter to chain together multiple Transformers for initialization:\n\n    from sklearn.pipeline import Pipeline\n    from sklearn.decomposition import PCA\n    from sklearn.ensemble import RandomForestClassifier\n    \n    pipeline = Pipeline(steps=[('scaler', StandardScaler()),\n                               ('pca', PCA(n_components=2, random_state=42)),\n                               ('estimator', RandomForestClassifier(n_estimators=3, max_depth=5))])\n\nThe [official documentation](https://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/compose.html?ref=dataleadsfuture.com#pipeline) points out that the last Transformer must be an Estimator.\n\nIf you don't need to specify each Transformer's name, you can simplify the creation of a Pipeline with `make_pipeline`:\n\n    from sklearn.pipeline import make_pipeline\n    \n    pipeline_2 = make_pipeline(StandardScaler(),\n                               PCA(n_components=2, random_state=42),\n                               RandomForestClassifier(n_estimators=3, max_depth=5))\n\n Understanding the Pipeline's mechanism from the source code\n\nWe've mentioned the importance of not letting test data variables leak into training data when using each Transformer.\n\nThis principle is relatively easy to ensure when each data preprocessing step is independent.\n\nBut what if we integrate these steps using a Pipeline?\n\nIf we look at the [official documentation](https://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/compose.html?ref=dataleadsfuture.com#pipeline), we find it simply uses the fit  \n method on the entire dataset without explaining how to handle train and test data separately.\n\nWith this question in mind, I dived into the Pipeline's source code to find the answer.\n\nReading the source code revealed that although Pipeline implements `fit`, `fit_transform`, and `predict` methods, they work differently from regular Transformers.\n\nTake the following Pipeline creation process as an example:\n\n    from sklearn.pipeline import Pipeline\n    from sklearn.decomposition import PCA\n    from sklearn.ensemble import RandomForestClassifier\n    \n    pipeline = Pipeline(steps=[('scaler', StandardScaler()),\n                               ('pca', PCA(n_components=2, random_state=42)),\n                               ('estimator', RandomForestClassifier(n_estimators=3, max_depth=5))])\n\n The internal implementation can be represented by the following diagram: \n\n[ Internal implementation of the fit and predict methods when called. Image by Author ](https://preview.redd.it/okhwyg75gl7c1.png?width=684&format=png&auto=webp&s=8106360fcaeb17deea2adf04fc34228dd31a9fd7)\n\nAs you can see, when we call the `fit` method, Pipeline first separates Transformers from the Estimator.\n\nFor each Transformer, Pipeline checks if there's a `fit_transform` method; if so, it calls it; otherwise, it calls `fit`.\n\nFor the Estimator, it calls `fit` directly.\n\nFor the `predict` method, Pipeline separates Transformers from the Estimator.\n\nPipeline calls each Transformer's `transform` method in sequence, followed by the Estimator's `predict`  \n method.\n\nTherefore, when using a Pipeline, we still need to split train and test data. Then we simply call `fit` on the train data and `predict` on the test data.\n\nThere's a special case when combining Pipeline with `GridSearchCV` for hyperparameter tuning: you don't need to manually split train and test data. I'll explain this in more detail in the best practices section.\n\n## Best Practices for Using Transformers and Pipeline in Actual Applications\n\nNow that we've discussed the working principles of Transformers and Pipeline, it's time to fulfill the promise made in the title and talk about the best practices when combining Transformers with Pipeline in real projects.\n\n### Combining Pipeline with GridSearchCV for hyperparameter tuning\n\nIn a machine learning project, selecting the right dataset processing and algorithm is one aspect. After debugging the initial steps, it's time for parameter optimization.\n\nUsing `GridSearchCV` or `RandomizedSearchCV`, you can try different parameters for the Estimator to find the best fit:\n\n    import time\n    \n    from sklearn.model_selection import GridSearchCV\n    \n    pipeline = Pipeline(steps=[('scaler', StandardScaler()),\n                               ('pca', PCA()),\n                               ('estimator', RandomForestClassifier())])\n    param_grid = {'pca__n_components': [2, 'mle'],\n                  'estimator__n_estimators': [3, 5, 7],\n                  'estimator__max_depth': [3, 5]}\n    \n    start = time.perf_counter()\n    clf = GridSearchCV(pipeline, param_grid=param_grid, cv=5, n_jobs=4)\n    clf.fit(X, y)\n    \n    # It takes 2.39 seconds to finish the search on my laptop.\n    print(f\"It takes {time.perf_counter() - start} seconds to finish the search.\")\n\n But in machine learning, hyperparameter tuning is not limited to Estimator parameters; it also involves combinations of Transformer parameters.\n\nIntegrating all steps with Pipeline allows for hyperparameter tuning of every element with different parameter combinations.\n\nNote that during hyperparameter tuning, we no longer need to manually split train and test data. `GridSearchCV` will split the data into training and validation sets using [StratifiedKFold](https://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/cross_validation.html?ref=dataleadsfuture.com#stratified-k-fold), which implemented a k-fold cross validation mechanism.\n\n[ StratifiedKFold iterative process of splitting train data and test data. Image by Author ](https://preview.redd.it/uqnuo8fpgl7c1.png?width=681&format=png&auto=webp&s=bd6b5f7edb2d4f5e71786fd6c0f45745ea2095d9)\n\n We can also set the number of folds for cross-validation and choose how many workers to use. The tuning process is illustrated in the following diagram: \n\n[ Internal implementation of GridSearchCV hyperparameter tuning. Image by Author ](https://preview.redd.it/piqqv9nrgl7c1.png?width=699&format=png&auto=webp&s=1bb2a2d4739e8100e71559fb9f9e0cfaa4846803)\n\n Due to space constraints, I won't go into detail about `GridSearchCV` and `RandomizedSearchCV` here. If you're interested, I can write another article explaining them next time. \n\n### Using the memory parameter to cache Transformer outputs\n\nOf course, hyperparameter tuning with `GridSearchCV` can be slow, but that's no worry, Pipeline provides a caching mechanism to speed up the tuning efficiency by caching the results of intermediate steps.\n\nWhen initializing a Pipeline, you can pass in a memory parameter, which will cache the results after the first call to `fit` and `transform` for each transformer.\n\nIf subsequent calls to fit and `transform` use the same parameters, which is very likely during hyperparameter tuning, these steps will directly read the results from the cache instead of recalculating, significantly speeding up the efficiency when running the same Transformer repeatedly.\n\nThe `memory` parameter can accept the following values:\n\n* The default is None: caching is not used.\n* A string: providing a path to store the cached results.\n* A `joblib.Memory` object: allows for finer-grained control, such as configuring the storage backend for the cache.\n\nNext, let's use the previous `GridSearchCV` example, this time adding `memory` to the Pipeline to see how much speed can be improved:\n\n    pipeline_m = Pipeline(steps=[('scaler', StandardScaler()),\n                               ('pca', PCA()),\n                               ('estimator', RandomForestClassifier())],\n                          memory='./cache')\n    start = time.perf_counter()\n    clf_m = GridSearchCV(pipeline_m, param_grid=param_grid, cv=5, n_jobs=4)\n    clf_m.fit(X, y)\n    \n    # It takes 0.22 seconds to finish the search with memory parameter.\n    print(f\"It takes {time.perf_counter() - start} seconds to finish the search with memory.\")\n\nAs shown, with caching, the tuning process only takes 0.2 seconds, a significant speed increase from the previous 2.4 seconds.\n\n### How to debug Scikit-Learn Pipeline\n\nAfter integrating Transformers into a Pipeline, the entire preprocessing and transformation process becomes a black box. It can be difficult to understand which step the process is currently on.\n\nFortunately, we can solve this problem by adding logging to the Pipeline.  \nWe need to create custom transformers to add logging at each step of data transformation.\n\nHere's an example of adding logging with Python's standard logging library:\n\nFirst, you need to configure a logger:\n\n    import logging\n    \n    from sklearn.base import BaseEstimator, TransformerMixin\n    \n    logging.basicConfig(level=logging.INFO, format='%(asctime)s - %(levelname)s - %(message)s')\n    logger = logging.getLogger()\n\n Next, you can create a custom Transformer and add logging within its methods: \n\n    class LoggingTransformer(BaseEstimator, TransformerMixin):\n        def __init__(self, transformer):\n            self.transformer = transformer\n            self.real_name = self.transformer.__class__.__name__\n    \n        def fit(self, X, y=None):\n            logging.info(f\"Begin fit: {self.real_name}\")\n            self.transformer.fit(X, y)\n            logging.info(f\"End fit: {self.real_name}\")\n            return self\n    \n        def fit_transform(self, X, y=None):\n            logging.info(f\"Begin fit_transform: {self.real_name}\")\n            X_fit_transformed = self.transformer.fit_transform(X, y)\n            logging.info(f\"End fit_transform: {self.real_name}\")\n            return X_fit_transformed\n    \n        def transform(self, X):\n            logging.info(f\"Begin transform: {self.real_name}\")\n            X_transformed = self.transformer.transform(X)\n            logging.info(f\"End transform: {self.real_name}\")\n            return X_transformed\n\n Then you can use this `LoggingTransformer` when creating your Pipeline: \n\n    pipeline_logging = Pipeline(steps=[('scaler', LoggingTransformer(StandardScaler())),\n                                 ('pca', LoggingTransformer(PCA(n_components=2))),\n                                 ('estimator', RandomForestClassifier(n_estimators=5, max_depth=3))])\n    pipeline_logging.fit(X_train, y_train)\n\n[ The effect after adding the LoggingTransformer. Image by Author ](https://preview.redd.it/53kl3padhl7c1.png?width=664&format=png&auto=webp&s=a3e3d9dcf25f0ee8dc7234e1db9280ce1cd15b0d)\n\nWhen you use `pipeline.fit`, it will call the `fit` and `transform` methods for each step in turn and log the appropriate messages.\n\n### Use passthrough in Scikit-Learn Pipeline\n\nIn a Pipeline, a step can be set to `'passthrough`', which means that for this specific step, the input data will pass through unchanged to the next step.\n\nThis is useful when you want to selectively enable/disable certain steps in a complex pipeline.\n\nTaking the code example above, we know that when using `DecisionTree` or `RandomForest`, standardizing the data is unnecessary, so we can use `passthrough` to skip this step.\n\nAn example would be as follows:\n\n    param_grid = {'scaler': ['passthrough'],\n                  'pca__n_components': [2, 'mle'],\n                  'estimator__n_estimators': [3, 5, 7],\n                  'estimator__max_depth': [3, 5]}\n    clf = GridSearchCV(pipeline, param_grid=param_grid, cv=5, n_jobs=4)\n    clf.fit(X, y)\n\n Reusing the Pipeline\n\nAfter a journey of trials and tribulations, we finally have a well-performing machine learning model.\n\nNow, you might consider how to reuse this model, share it with colleagues, or deploy it in a production environment.\n\nHowever, the result of a model's training includes not only the model itself but also the various data processing steps, which all need to be saved.\n\nUsing `joblib` and Pipeline, we can save the entire training process for later use. The following code provides a simple example:\n\n    from joblib import dump, load\n    \n    # save pipeline\n    dump(pipeline, 'model_pipeline.joblib')\n    \n    # load pipeline\n    loaded_pipeline = load('model_pipeline.joblib')\n    \n    # predict with loaded pipeline\n    loaded_predictions = loaded_pipeline.predict(X_test)\n\n This article was originally published on my personal blog [Data Leads Future.](https://www.dataleadsfuture.com/ensuring-correct-use-of-transformers-in-scikit-learn-pipeline/) \n\n&#x200B;",

But if down sampling is needed, sklearn + numpy probably can't handle the data volume anyways.\n\nFor some of \"production run\", I can See pipeline being useful.

            "Thanks for the contribution. If you're looking for a more advanced followup topic, I think there is a lack of guidance on using FeatureUnion and ColumnTransformer to do heterogenous preprocessing (e.g. impute some variables, standardize some variables, OHE these ones, ordinal encode these others, etc). Actually the biggest hurdle I had recently was doing all that with specified interactions in the pipeline as well (using the PolynomialFeatures function). If I had more time I'd probably contribute examples back to the sklearn docs or a blog, but happy if someone else takes it up : )\n\nThanks again. I love pipelines for quickly iterating in a new project.",

This has caused the supply of data science/statistician jobs to decline while the supply of interested applicants has never been higher (thanks to the current AI-craze).\n\nData Science is difficult and often requires hard work, talent, _and_ real investment to get right. It\u2019s said that ~80% of ML models these days never make it into production. Despite these facts, the field has also been WAY overhyped by bootcamps, undergrad programs, and people working in or adjacent to the industry. This has caused a massive influx of both entry-level _and_ senior-level talent (from adjacent disciplines) to Data Science, many of whom simply don\u2019t have the skills or the drive to obtain the skills that they would need to ensure an ROI on their contributions. \n\nBecause of the above \u261d\ufe0f, not every company is equipped or can afford to fund the investment in time, talent, and resources that is required to solve a data science-esque problem that can actually turn into a profitable product\u2026 and some of them are starting to notice. \n\nNOTE: I believe ANYONE with enough determination can make it into this field.

        "content": "I've been stuck on the following problem for weeks now. To be clear I'm not asking the community to provide a full solution. Just a few ideas or at least confirmation on whether this problem statement is solvable with the data available at hand. Thanks.\n\n**Context:** I work for a company that rents out stuff. During user checkout, there's a rule-based risk engine that determines whether to auto-approve user (takes seconds) or send for manual approval (takes days). This engine utilizes only basic features such as credit score, rent items category, cart value etc. Lets say that around 40% of all instances go to manual approval. Actual rejection rate is around 1-2% that means most of the cases sent for manual approval could have just been auto-approved.\n\n**Objective:** Reduce dependency on manual approval as much as possible (to lets say 5%). If this was a binary classification task (manual or not) then we'd say recall is important here. Thus, deprecate legacy system as it is too rudimentary.\n\nNow, boss wants me to achieve this by creating a regression model using customer credit history, and purchase history to predict ***maximum allowed***  ^(\u2020)***active-sourcing-cost per user***. So that if a user tries checking out cart that brings their total active sourcing cost above their max allowed limit, they will be sent for manual approval instead of auto-approve.\n\n>^(\u2020)*active-sourcing-cost is the total purchase cost to company of all items the user currently is renting*\n\n**Data available:** User purchase history, user credit history (experian), product details, NPA data (data of users who failed to return the items they have rented, thus defaulted)\n\n**Issues with proposed solution:**\n\n1. Max allowed sourcing cost per user unavailable as the target variable (No recorded ground truth for any samples)\n2. No relevant proxy variables available as ground truth (that I can think of)\n\nTried explaining that lack of relevant ground truth is an issue. But am being pushed for a solution so have to produce.\n\n**My alternate half-baked solution:**\n\n1. Use legacy system for auto approvals only. This acts as a filter.\n2. To the rest of the data that would otherwise be sent for manual verification we add NPA users and tag as a negative class. This would be the training data.\n3. Train binary classification model (npa vs. not npa).\n4. What the model classifies as NPA would then be sent for manual, rest will be auto approved.\n\n&#x200B;",

            "There\u2019s lots of short-hand in your post, so you\u2019ll have to excuse us if we don\u2019t understand your objective. I do think this is a good post, because it is very indicative of a typical task in DS that is not directly related to ML.\n\nImo your ground truth variable should be whether the customer broke, lost, or otherwise damaged the rental goods, and the dollar value of the damage. Use their credit score and other explanatory variables to train a model predicting the probability that a customer will break their rental items. That prediction, along with your rental pricing, will predict whether the rental will be profitable or not. Risky, but potentially profitable cases can be forwarded for manual review.\n\nOn an additional note, it would be good to explore whether the manual review is better at predicting rental item damage than your model.\n\nJust some thoughts. I\u2019m curious to hear if anyone has experience with something similar.",
            "I think there\u2019s a missing step, I think a model ought to be able to predict the probability of a loss above some dollar value based on the data given, but then it\u2019s business logic how that should be mapped to a maximum allowed sourcing cost. \n\nI\u2019d consider reframing it as an exercise to predict the probability of a loss exceeding $X, and then it\u2019s up to the business to set the probability threshold for manual review to achieve a target rate - if the target is to review eg. the top 5% highest risk orders, I imagine it should be straightforward to calculate the threshold given your model estimates of loss probability",
            "This sub needs more posts like this! Thanks for sharing",
            "Long comment incoming!\n\nSo let's distinguish between two problems:\n\n1) Find a good (or even the best) decision rule to determine which transactions should be approved.\n\n2) Maintain the current decision rule but find a quicker/cheaper way of implementing it.\n\nBy the sounds of things your boss has asked you to solve problem 2, not problem 1. Furthermore, if they are asking for a regression model in terms of maximum total sourcing cost (or whatever the correct term is) it sounds like they want something fairly interpretable.\n\nLet's forget about this whole \"maximum total sourcing cost\" for a second first think about solving problem 2. You presumably could build a classification model that estimates the probability of being approved as a function of your observables (i.e. you are trying to predict \"if this went to manual review, would it get approved?\"). Presumably active sourcing cost can be one of the included variables. So your model would say things like \"this instance has an 0.997 probability of being approved if reviewed manually\", or \"this instance has an 0.5 probability of being approved\", or \"this instance has an 0.001 probability of being approved\". Depending on risk tolerances the first instance can be approved automatically, the second instance gets reviewed manually, the third instance could probably get rejected automatically but you likely don't have a pipeline for that yet so probably goes to manual review. So you'd set some threshold probability below which things get manually reviewed.\n\nI think that solves problem 2 but might lack interpretability. Furthermore, \"have a machine learning algorithm calculate a probability\" may or may not be easy for your company's tech stack in production.\n\nSo now let's start thinking a bit harder about this \"maximum allowed active sourcing cost\" idea.\n\nThat idea probably isn't well defined. For instance, if your data are from the real world you'll probably find examples where user A had a lower active sourcing cost than user B and the two users were otherwise the same, but user B was approved and user A was not. (If you don't have any instances like this you can actually use support vector machines and won't need to manually review anything ever.)\n\nSo while we likely cannot calculate \"maximum allowed\" active sourcing cost, what can be done is to calculate \"the active sourcing cost above which the probability of approval drops below a threshold\" (e.g. 0.95). How to do this? Well, your machine learning algorithm spits out probabilities and includes active sourcing cost as a variable - so find whatever active sourcing cost is required to make the probability equal to the threshold (worst case plug in a big number and a small number and then do a binary search algorithm).\n\nOkay, but that sounds hard to explain and again might be hard to put into production. What does the absolute simplest version of this look like?\n\nProbit regression, particularly focusing on its interpretation involving latent variables. That is, one way of thinking about probit regression is modelling a latent (unobserved) variable - I'm going to use the single variable case here - Y\\* = a + bX + e. a and b are constants to be estimated, X is the explanatory variable, and e is a random variable that follows a normal distribution with mean 0 and variance 1 (so not 2.71...). Y\\* is therefore a continuous number. We don't see Y\\* but instead see Y, which is 1 if Y\\* is greater than zero and zero otherwise.\n\nTypically the way probit regressions are used is if we see X we can calculate the probability that Y = 1 by evaluating a + bX and then plugging it in to the CDF of the standard normal distribution.\n\nBut we can go in the other direction - we can ask, for instance, \"What is the X at which the probability Y = 1 is 0.95?\". This would mean that e is the 0.95 percentile of the standard normal distribution, which is about 1.645. Then solve a + bX + 1.645 = 0 for X, which gives X = (1.645 - a)/b.\n\nSo what is this number? Assuming b < 0 (i.e. higher X makes Y = 1 less likely) it's the X below which the probability that Y = 1 is above 0.95. So for instance, if X is the user's total sourcing cost and Y is whether they were approved, (1.645 - a)/b represents an X at which the probability of being approved is extremely high.\n\nAnd the nice thing here is that as long as your probit regression is linear in the user's active sourcing cost you can repeat the algebra with more variables and land up with an expression for the active sourcing cost above which manual review is required as a linear function of observables - which should be very easy to implement in any tech stack.\n\nTwo additional points:\n\n- Do check that a simple probit fits the data reasonably well before using it: the more complicated approaches might be worth it if the fit is a lot better.\n\n- Consider having some small number of users that are automatically approved go through the manual process anyway (or approve them but send their case to manual review separately): this validates that the model is performing correctly and provides additional observations that can be included in data sets when the model gets updated.",
            "Great question! And some great answers here already, so I won't get too in the weeds.\n\nI'd think of this as a simple formula where the max allowed active sourcing cost for a user is the probability of them breaking, damaging, etc. the item (depends on what matters for you. I might use \"the item was not usable when it came back\" or \"the item didn't come back\" or something) times the cost of the item for you. for instance, if I have a 25% chance of not returning a $1000 item, then your expected value cost is $250. This also could turn into some kind of joint probability problem where if I rent two items and I have a 30% chance of not returning each and they each cost $1000, then maybe your total expected cost is $300 + $300 - $90 = $510. Again, this is a post-initial rollout type improvement, but something to consider.\n\nSo from that setup, you'd predict the probability of an adverse event (them not returning the item or similar) for each customer, and then your \"target\" in the \"regression\" problem just scales linearly with that probability + the cost of whatever they're trying to rent"

        "content": "I'm an R&D engineer working for an international company in the chemical/engineering business. I am the only one in my team with some data analytics skills. I typically spend about 20% of my time coding and analysing data for my projects (sometimes I get asked to support other colleagues too). Nothing fancy, some statistical analysis, a lot of data viz and sometimes simple modelling mostly for inferential purposes.\nOver the years my company built a relatively large and very centralized data science team, they do the heavy lifting and create production quality code.  \nIn the early days I enjoyed dealing with them, they were happy that I could read the code and understand the lingo so we could cooperate very smoothly on the same project. Typically we went through their code together on a weekly basis. By the end of the project  I was aware of most of the technical decision made along the way and I could explain it pretty comfortably to the stakeholders. So much so that I started thing about a career switch. Now that team is gone and the newcomers are more senior and operate very differently. They typically provide their report on powerpoint and quite high level too, I had a few instances when I reached out and got dismissed. One particular time after they analysed some data for an RD&E project I asked the code specifying that I was really eager to learn and I got denied. Their justification was that they were afraid their code would be used the wrong way.  \nThey don't seem to be interested in cooperating the same way, they rather get the data, ask all the questions, and share their final findings. They do not interact much along the way.\n\nThis situation has been going on for over a year already, I thought I could find a sweet spot bridging between RD&E and data science, but I'm now having second thoughts and thinking I'm better off in my bubble. I'm very hesitant involving them in any project unless strictly necessary.   \nI'm interested to hear some opinion from data scientists as I'm trying to put myself in their shoes. Am I being too intrusive? Have you ever had similar experiences from the opposite side? Also do you have any career advice? Is there any value for someone with a foot in both shoes?",

            "what happened to the previous team? current one seems defensive & gate keeping",
            "There is absolutely value in having a foot in both shoes, as you put it. I think the most productive data science work is done when there is an understanding of how the analysis support decisions, and that means understanding how analysis converts into practice in the hands of the non-data scientist.\n\nWhat you describe sounds like fairly standard institutional rot. It happens easily that departments within companies develop self-interests. A lot of standard management theory is how to deal with this and still make everyone pull in the same direction. So in some ways, what you describe is neither data science specific, nor is it something that is entirely in your power to adjust, since it is a question of group dynamics. I've seen this happen as startups grow from being small and scrappy to larger and internally fragmented.\n\nThat said, some things can be done on the margins. You describe the risk that data science teams become isolated and not involved. That is a \"stick\" that can induce change. A team that few see the value of is the first to go when downsizing happens. Is there someone in the data science team who can take that bigger perspective and understand that part of their self-interest is to be useful to others? You need someone on the other side to bridge build with. One person can be enough, you do not have to get the entire team to like you.\n\nTrying to change the old ways of doing things through specialized projects could be a way to induce change. Say you identify a potential project, not too large in scope, that could involve the data science team, but in different ways than usual. The point is that you constrain the efforts such that the deliverable simply is not a PowerPoint presentation, but code that runs somewhere doing something. I am hand-waving since this requires creativity and domain-specific understanding. But as I argued above, I think what you describe is very typical stuff that happens when ways of doing things become settled. So change the way things are done, unsettled the old ways a bit.\n\nMaybe also they have some good reasons to be dismissive of you. Perhaps some analysis has become sufficiently routine that it can be automated far more and all the decision-makers need is the bottom line finding. This is also part of becoming more professional, to speed up some stuff that have adequate solutions such that one can focus on value creation and problem-solving elsewhere in the company. This is not to say that you should stop being interested or inquisitive, only that there can be good reasons for you to move on and find more productive areas to get involved in. This is part of the give and take of teamwork and in a well-run company, there is acceptance that sometimes people challenge others in what they do and argue for change. Friction is part of business, especially if you look to go outside your comfort zone and the organizational boundaries.",
            "this is my experience with my current team. they are _on the same team as me_ and refuse to collaborate. i often get a \u201cyou\u2019re not a data scientist\u201d or \u201cthis project is different from normal software engineering\u201d vibe from them. in my experience working with this team for 3 years, when they don\u2019t want to share there\u2019s something to hide. for 2 years i tried to explain to the team that the reported metrics don\u2019t play out in testing. i was thoroughly dismissed. at the end of those two years an independent audit was performed where the inference metrics bore out barely better than random. everyone was super surprised except for me and a handful of other engineers. \n\nTL;DR i start with a new team on Monday.",
            "this type of behaviors often rise from the fact that how your data science team is valued in the organization. If they work on a \"get project from other teams in the org and work on them\" fashion; then giving you their codes essentially reduces their usability  as a group.\n\nAlso there are other things like political agenda within groups of teams and gate keeping.\n\nPS: not all teams are like this",

Nobody else can really answer the question for you since your reasons for staying are strictly personal and don\u2019t have high weight from a career and financial perspective (especially if you live in a small town without much opportunity). Consider the likelihood of finding a similar job if you stay (remote or in-person close to where you want to stay), how happy you\u2019ll be in place versus the other, and if staying in your home state is truly the best option for things you\u2019ve mentioned. I personally am very pro-explore. You\u2019re young and have probably lived a fairly sheltered life up to this point based on your reasons for wanting to stay. My vote would be take the great offer right out of school, explore a new big city, and see if it is the life you want. Living in the same place forever seems boring and uneventful to me. You can always move back, but you might be wondering for a while what would have come from taking the leap into new territory if you decide to turn down the opportunity.",

People need to show progress and talk about what they are getting hung up on or they will assume they should grind away for days at something that can be solved in 5 minutes by someone else on the team. Yes, this can be done as a slack post instead of a video meeting, but that also means people need to engage with the slack posts.\n\nA team of 6 people who all are pretty competent and know how and when to ask for help, just skip it. \n\nIf you are mostly/only assigning out short-term tasks meant to take a couple days to complete, then yes stand- ups are worth it. That short task length means you need to know who's finishing sooner and needs more work or has capacity to help someone else. I have not seen many DS work like that, but at some startups where everything is try something out quick and see if there is any promise, it does happen. \n\nI've been at places where daily standup was mostly just a game to make people feel like they were part of a team even though no one really knew what anyone else was working on and had no chance of a smooth handoff if someone left.

I think these diagrams are a much more elegant way of visualizing overlapping sets than alternatives such as Venn and Euler diagrams. I consulted [this Medium article](https://medium.com/@narayanmahto/visualizing-intersecting-sets-upset-chart-in-python-cf72e4cad5b1) that purported to explain how to create these plots in Python, but the instructions seemed to have been ripped directly from the projects' GitHub pages, which have not been updated in several years.\n\n[One project by Lex et. al 2014](https://upset.app/) seems to work fairly well, but it has that 'matplotlib-esque' look to it. In other words, it seems visually outdated. I like creating views with libraries like Plotly, because it has a more modern look and feel, but noticed there is no UpSet figure available in the figure factory. So, I decided to create my own.\n\n# Introducing 'upsetty'\n\n[upsetty](https://github.com/eskin22/upsetty) is a new Python package [available on PyPI](https://pypi.org/project/upsetty/) that you can use to create upset plots to visualize intersecting sets.

On the downhill sections of the road you aren't pressing the accelerator at all (possibly breaking) to maintain 40 mph.\n\nIn this example, there is *no correlation* between how hard you are pressing on the accelerator and speed, as the speed stays constant.

        "content": "I'm building a product for the video game, League of Legends, that will give players 3-6 distinct things to focus on in the game, that will increase their chances of winning the most.\n\nFor my technical background, I thought I wanted to be a data scientist, but transitioned to data engineering, so I have a very fundamental grasp of machine learning concepts. This is why I want input from all of you wonderfully smart people about the way I want to calculate these \"important\" columns.\n\nI know that the world of explanability is still uncertain, but here is my approach:\n\n1. I am given a dataset of matches of a single player, where each row represents the stats of this player at the end of the match. There are \\~100 columns (of things like kills, assists, damage dealt, etc) after dropping the columns with any NULLS in it.\n   1. There is a binary WIN column that shows whether the player won the match or not. This is the column we are most interested in\n2. I train a simple tree-based model on this data, and get the list of \"feature importances\" using sklearn's `permutation_importance()` function.\n   1. For some reason (maybe someone can explain), there are a large number of columns that return a ZERO feature importance after computing this.\n3. This is where I do things differently: I RETRAIN the model using the same dataset, but without the columns that returned 0 importance on the last \"run\"\n4. I basically repeat this process until the list of feature importances doesn't contain ZERO.\n   1. The end result is that there are usually 3-20 columns left (depending on the model).\n5. I take the top N (haven't decided yet) columns and \"give\" them to the user to focus on in their next game\n\nTheoretically, if \"feature importance\" really lives up to it's name, the ending model should have only the \"most important\" columns when trying to achieve a win.\n\nI've tried using SHAP/LIME, but they were more complicated that using straight feature importance.\n\nLike I mentioned, I don't have classical training in ML or Statistics, so all of this is stuff I tried to learn on my own at one point. I appreciate any helpful advice on if this approach makes sense/is valid. \n\n# The big question is: are there any problems with this approach, and are the resulting set of columns truly the \"most important?\"",

            "I think a better approach would be to train a model (can be RF) on all players and then for each player compute SHAP values for their observations (games). Then for given player you can take features with most negative average SHAP values to find out important features that actually make them lose games.",
            "Ok so as a leauge player and a data something or another -- first i would actually explore the data and see what models would work best \n\nKills always seem nice to track but 3/0/12 is alot different than 3/7/12 is alot different from 3/3/0\nSo while kills may return zero -- Kill /death ratio may impact the binary value win. Time is also very important in leauge so if you have variables at time stamps, looking at those, transforming them and exploring them may be a good idea.\n\nSo some of you variables may need transformation, granular variables are important to like cs (creep score) \n\nAlot of these variables are actually just stand ins for gold -- so if you have gold at different time stamps that might be really good data. But the point is to explore the data, run some charts and see if there are linear relationships amongst some variables and note any transformations you would like. \n\nOnce you explore the data start thinking strategically about the model you want and why -- what are the core relationships and go fron there.\n\nTry something like this out and if it works give me a call to share some of that riot money (i have alot more detailed ideas but i dont want to do all your homework for you)",

Get more kills, you win more games when you have more kills! Disregarding the fact the games that led to more kills were the games where the user happened to have used defensive wards to not die to a lvl 3-4 gank and get snowballed on.\n\nSpecific tips that were champion specific could be usefull, but dont come from a model: as an assassin, ambush someone using a pink ward / sweeper. That is a class specific tip and objective that could prove useful in a game and lead to a victory, and it comes from game knowledge and cant come from a model (with what seems to be your data).\n\nBut I'm sure your boss will want an answer for a metric to track, so I'll give you some freebies:\nLess deaths, higher gold earned, objectives complete (neutrals, towers), vision score, damage dealt or taken /healing and shield.",

All you can do is make the requirements more specific and the application more detailed, so that you have a rationale for quickly culling to a manageable subset.

The most effective interview I've been on the receiving end has been when I was verbally given a very open-ended description of a problem, and asked how I would solve it. I think it's a waste of time to probe about things like \"wait do you know what a Type 1 error is?\" when it takes two seconds to Google. We're hiring DSs because they can leverage data to solve business problems. Present them with a problem, and watch how their wheels start to turn. Someone who has no experience might just start listing the usual steps \"well first I'll do some EDA, and then I'll fit a linear model....\" but someone with more experience probably pauses to ask questions, to understand the scope, to talk about the numerous approaches they'd do depending on the specifics, ask what kind of baselines there are, what constraints there are, etc.",
            "This kinda depends on the level, and my perspective is as a hiring manager so take this with a grain of salt.\n\nI am gonna presume that anyone in a data scientist interview can load libraries and run an xgboost.\n\nBut technical can be evaluated with some simple tests. I'd provide an obviously bad chi-sq (or confusion matrix) and ask them that if they got these results what would they look at next. You could do this once or twice.\n\nThen I'd give a test with some data thing (maybe something requiring a CTE or windows function) in SQL. If not that maybe something in python.\n\nTo determine partnering ability, I'd probably ask them about a model they want to make and ask them to pitch it to me. I'd try to push a bit to ask questions about why and see how they explain something technical. I am presuming this is for a data scientist role and therefore not junior and also has some previous data experience.\n\nIn short, I ask about how they try to solve problems and see what steps are available beyond what we know. And I always ignore syntax...as long as they can walk through conceptually I don't care if they say merge or join or screw up a count or whatever.",

The job title \u201cData Scientist\u201d is so absurdly vague and can mean dramatically different things at different places. If you botch this step, you\u2019re wasting everyone\u2019s time. When you know those criteria, test for them. \n\nAnd a quick addendum: if you ask technical questions, let people use google - if restricting resources is necessary then your question is a gotcha, not an indicator of ability."

            "u/relevantmeemayhere and a few others gave you some of the best advice here that's grounded in science.  I want to stress what's been suggested already: the way you do feature selection (and feature importance - the other side of the coin) really depends on whether you want prediction or explanation/inference/causal. To me, it sounds like you're after prediction.\n\nOne approach that I would *only* suggest for prediction is if you have a very large sample sizes, and numerous potential features, consider having an additional training set just to run some univariate screening (t-tests, chi-squared, odds ratios, correlations etc.). This is a no-no for explanatory models and even more so without a dedicated training set.\n\nRegardless of feature selection per-se, there are steps you could do that result in selecting-features:\n\n* Use domain knowledge to pre-select candidate features (lit. reviews, expert opinions, collaboration) + critical evaluation (I often keep the Bradford Hill criteria at the back of my mind).\n* DAGs (Direct Acyclic Graph) can be helpful both for explanatory and predictive models\n* Keep features that are known to have a strong relationship with the target, regardless of what you see in the data (e.g. predicting wages should almost always account for gender and education even though it may not be apparent in your data)\n* Remove features that are either too expensive to collect or subject to high measurement error\n* Eliminate features that are near constant/little variation or that are missing on too large a portion of the data\n* If you suspect having many noisy features or highly correlated ones, spend some time thinking about a sound modelling strategies, since some algos are more sensitive to noise than others (cough... NNET...cough ;-))\n* Stay away from recursive feature elimination (RFE) if you have even modest collinearity  \n\n\nThis is the paper you want to read: [State of the art in selection of variables and functional forms in multivariable analysis](https://diagnprognres.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s41512-020-00074-3).

Second order effects are more challenging to estimate/project.

But with a disruption/shock as profound as the AI singularity, you need a general equilibrium analysis because pretty much everything will be simultaneously affected. Ironically, the only way to do this well might be via an agent-based model that leverages AI. \n\nIn any event, if I were new to the field, I don't think the right question is \"Will AI make me obsolete in 10 years?\" Rather, the question is how will AI change the nature of the work of data analysis/engineering/science and how can I leverage it to be more productive?",

But the project overall is co-owned by everyone, with the PM assuming a lot more of the reporting and communication stuff. A Data Scientist tends to describe his contribution by stating \"I built this model\", \"I productionalized this pipeline\", or \"I completed this analysis\", etc. While a PM describes it in the form \"My team did...\".",

            "At most of the places I\u2019ve worked, the business knew the why the best while data science worked with business to define the what. PMs were basically secretaries, on the projects that went well. We\u2019d occasionally get a PM that thought he knew best and tried to own the what and why and it was always a train wreck. Everything became a game of telephone because what really mattered was the business context and the technical details but now details of both had to go through some idiot PM before reaching the other side. I\u2019ve had projects that completely lacked a PM go exceptionally well, although that probably requires experienced data scientists.",
            "As a data scientist, I need to say it is impossible to know more than the people working with \"the problem\" daily. You might have a different view and discover stuff they didn't think about, but we still need to stay humble and be aware of what we know: ML, but not necessarily anything about the domain we apply it to.\n\nI work for a large company with different subdivisions and a very large and broad product portfolio in a central position. There is absolutely no way for me to understand the problems, products or business better than those in the divisions.",
            "Data science doesn't work if you don't know the why. It's that simple. PMs who are unwilling to discuss the 'why' behind an ask are actively detrimental. It has to be a conversation. PMs lack the expertise to know what is possible, so when they attempt to define solutions and just say \"Well figure out how to make it work\" it goes badly.\n\nGreat PMs will dig in with their stakeholders and make sure they know exactly what problem their stakeholder needs solved (which is rarely the same thing as what the stakeholder says they want), then engage with DS to discuss how they can solve that problem without attempting to pre-define what the solution will be. They come to a consensus on an approach they think will address the underlying problem, and then help divide the work between whatever parties are needed (including wrangling people who have what you need). They will help sell the stakeholder on the proposed solution and keep them informed so DS can work instead of being in meetings all day. They'll also prevent DS from becoming side tracked with other problems. Not killing off tangents immediately- sometime's that's how you discover the really valuable insights- but preventing DS from falling down unproductive rabbit holes (we've all seen it happen).\n\nGood PMs will bring DS and stakeholders together in meetings and facilitate communication to help the DS team figure out what the actual problem is, then follow up afterwards to define a solution. They will help sell the plan to stakeholders (they may not own presenting it, but they will at least help with it), and help put DS in contact with the right people to get whatever resources are needed. They'll act as a communication channel between DS and stakeholders as the process continues but DS will likely still end up giving a lot of update presentations (just not enough to be a big productivity drain). They'll help keep things on task.\n\nBad PMs think they're great PMs. Except they think they never probe exactly what the real problem their stakeholders are having is and just take the stated problem at face value, which is like a doctor who gives a patient complaining of a splitting pain in their side some aspirin and fucking off. They avoid letting DS and stakeholders directly interact because they don't want executives to have to deal with the smelly nerds who ask all these annoying questions. They attempt to dictate the proper solution to a problem and tell the DS team to figure out how to make it work, and blame the DS team if it isn't possible and refuse to accept that the DS team usually can't definitively tell you if something is predictable without any preliminary research. Then they refuse to listen to any alternative ideas and attempt to shut down any investigation of new discoveries that might lead to alternative solutions because it's not what they wanted. They'll attempt to keep stakeholders in the loop but because they think they're great PMs and they think they understand more than they do, they won't listen carefully to DS (no matter how many times they're told a distinction is really important) and will mislead or tell stakeholders things that are flat-out untrue. You have to work around these people if you want to get anything done, and they will make sure to blame the lazy/incompetent data scientists whenever their hair-brained scheme falls apart, and since the stakeholders only ever hear from them they'll tend to buy it.\n\nI've never worked with a great PM, but I've had a manager who was like that. I'm pretty firmly convinced it's only possible with a strong technical background and actual DS experience. I've had the pleasure of working with some good PMs as well, and if you get them then consider yourself lucky. Unfortunately, in my experience most PMs are mediocre to bad. The problem is a mediocre PM, even while less actively painful to work with than a bad PM, still has to be worked around to some extent, and just acts as an additional source of meetings. The reality is for the majority of organizations they'd be better off eliminating PMs because all they do is put someone between problem-haver and problem-solver who has does not really understand the problem or what solutions are possible."

An LLM can probably play a comparatively short game of chess pretty well, because book moves/book openings are well-documented ie it's basically \"stealing\" moves from actual chess computers. As the length of the game goes on, I would imagine the likelihood of the LLM making a mistake would increase substantially. \n\nOne could test this by having it play a real chess computer, with the goal in mind of extending game length (if that's possible without throwing the game).  My guess is that once the game becomes original, the LLM becomes pretty bad at chess. \n\nIn other words - the LLM is effectively just playing by the book. The moment there is no book to play off of, it probably becomes bad at the game. I'm not an expert on LLMs or Chess tho",

            "My take is that the model is fine-tuned on a large database of master's games. If you think about it, LLMs are well suited to this kind of thing. Moves in a chess game appear in a sequence. LLMs are next token prediction algorithms with a long memory for past \"words\" or \"moves\" (tokens really) in a given sequence. This is memory analogous to memory in recurrent neural networks, but the algorithm is trainable in linear time. An LLM trained on a master's database should tend to walk down a well-trodden path through a chess game. I bet strategically, it's best to try to play novelties and avoid main lines against an AI like this.\n\nThanks OP, for passing this along.",

They moved from engineering to data science, but faked past n years of experience as data science experience and proclaimed they know many things in data science. In just a single session, you get judged by your junior and it decides the respect you will command from your team. I have also seen many directors who know their limit and try to work accordingly by focusing on people management and team building. It all boils down to playing to your strength.\n\nNow given that you have a PhD, you can use your skills in problem scoping, problem validation, solution prototyping, data science theory etc and guide your team and leave the work on tools like python, AWS etc. to your team. Maybe you can pick some one promising in your team, guide and fastrack them which in the long run can help the team.",

Your team will learn very quickly given the opportunity, and I expect you bring a huge amount of experience regardless of stack to be able to support them.\n\nPersonally I'd focus on the best ways to up skill your team; training, projects, secondments, cross company collab? It depends a bit on what they are lacking as a team, is it coding experience, getting models out in production or business knowledge? \n\nObviously if you can also argue that your team needs more experience, perhaps you can go down that route.\n\nI think you can affect more here than you're giving yourself credit for.\n\nMy other thought in this is my personal belief that LLMs are going to fundamentally change how DS is done, so I'd focus on that more.

        "content": "(Hope this is the right subreddit as many people post job-related/job-seeking questions. If not, I'm sorry, that's an honest mistake.)\n\nHello everyone. I was recently hired by one of the big corporations, and I would appreciate advice from the community.\n\nI was offered a high-level DS manager position at one of the MAANG companies. During the hiring process, I discussed with the hiring manager that I would start as an individual contributor, focusing on helping to improve the recommendation engine. Several months later, I was supposed to transition into managing a small team. I was extremely excited, it\u2019s MAANG, after all.\n\nHowever, on my very first day of the job, my manager\u2019s peer informed me that there had been a reorg. As a result, the tasks we had initially discussed would not be happening. To make matters worse, it turned out that my manager\u2019s planned promotion didn\u2019t materialize, leaving no team for me to manage. I thought, \u201cOkay, I can live with this. Worst-case scenario, I\u2019ll transfer to another team later.\u201d\n\nFast forward two weeks, and I honestly hate it. The tools we use are awful. Simple tasks that would take minutes outside of big tech now take up to an hour because our small databases constantly crash under load. Even building a basic causal model becomes incredibly challenging because we can\u2019t extract data from the database for a sufficiently long period. When I raised these concerns with my manager, their response was, \u201cI\u2019m not a fan of complex modeling. If you want to do that, let\u2019s outsource it to the Data Engineering (DE) team.\u201d\n\nWhat\u2019s more, my daily work involves adding charts to dashboards and handling ad hoc requests from various stakeholders. Nobody can clearly state our long-term goals or what we\u2019re trying to achieve. Our OKRs are DAU and Revenue, which are essentially driven by other company products (lol). The most disconcerting part is that every other Data Scientist in our part of the organization seems to be doing the same \u2014 ad-hocs, reports, and dashboards. Frankly, this doesn\u2019t feel like DS work at all.\n\nIn my previous workplace, I held the responsibility of creating models and introducing new ways to leverage data to increase our KPIs. My team was first to introduce causal modeling and ML-based user segmentation, we\u2019ve also piloted several other things that involved shipping models to production. When I decided to leave, my employer has repeated several times that should anything go wrong, I shouldn\u2019t hesitate and come back to working for them. I\u2019m seriously consider this option now. By the way it wasn't a small shop, that was an international company with petabytes of data and over a billion of revenue per year. Not the MAANG level though.\n\nMy current job offers better compensation, particularly if I can vest my stock options. However, during these several weeks, we\u2019ve already experienced another reorganization (3rd or 4th in 1.5 years), making it highly unlikely that I\u2019ll vest before the next round of layoffs.\n\nWhat would be the right move? To those familiar with MAANG companies, I\u2019d appreciate your insights. Is this situation normal?",

I believe this change was intended to lower profits but increase market share. So they did that and it probably would have worked had interest rates not increased as dramatically as they did. I don't think it was clearly AI failure AFAIK.",

A big one not mentioned here is the use of a copula function to group a bunch of mortgages and resell as less risky. Caused the Great Financial Crisis. An actuary of all people was behind it, but business was ready to use and abuse it. Long Term Capital Management and Russian bonds are another. You could get a better run down by googling it. Models are never perfect, but how they are used is the kicker.Or how about the Flash Crash caused by computer trading. I think the largest contributer to model risk is not accounting for dynamic, causal feedback from the broader system. people can only have intended rationality and we are all very much bounded by our intelligence."

Given how they were massively underpaid and I wasn\u2019t allowed to raise their compensation, I had to find ways to get them on board \u2014 publication, conferences, just working with people who like what you do and appreciate it\u2026 Looked for mid-points to celebrate that came before \u201cthe new model is in prod and tested better\u201d because that would take too long. Also, the rest of the data team was keen on helping, so finding ways to free them.\n\nThere\u2019s a lot more I did in other teams, like explaining the role of data quality, defining internal data products, internal training\u2026",

And I think I could definitely do some interesting research, but my college is not a very reputable one \n* I am genuinely interested in that research topic but I think I would only put myself through that if it provides significant benefit for my career\n\nSo based on my current situation and my ambitions, do you guys think a PhD is something to fight for or something that simply is not that worth to pursue?",

I was also looking at maybe pursuing a phd afterwards but I have decided to start working instead. The general advice I have gotten after talking to current phd students and recruiters at career fairs is that a phd should not be done for optimal career advancement purposes, as it seems the work experience for the same amount of years it takes to complete a PhD is more valuable career wise (I\u2019m speaking generally, I\u2019m sure there are exceptions). I\u2019ve been told that a PhD should primarily be pursued for personal interest/passion and you should enjoy the academic life it entails.",

Literally nobody asks \u201cdo you have a PhD?\u201d We are all in the same role and paybands. In fact, I was promoted to senior before many of my colleagues that have PhDs. The one role where I think it would matter more is if you are in very specific research roles, where the goal is developing basic science. The downside to those roles is the pool is much smaller, so I think there is incredible upside to being a generalist.\n\nEarlier in my career I wanted to get a PhD desperately. For a number of reasons it didn\u2019t happen. Ultimately now it would make no difference where I am today. And the upside is I have 5-6 years where I continued to make good wages and able save aggressively for retirement, buy a house, etc so I am probably financially ahead as a result."

In academia if I plotted a line of best fit to some data I had to be ready with a dozen slides talking about where the data came from, how I cleaned it, what my hypothesis was, how I fit the data, etc etc, basically the whole scientific method. In industry if I say \u201chey this model looks like we could improve X by Y%\u201d then someone asks me if I\u2019m sure, and then a decision is made. No paper is written up, no conferences to spread the word, just a few questions about how sure you are, and then the information/decision is handed off to someone else. This probably varies based on the size of your company and the impact of the decision being made, but I have a hard time imagining any company moves slower than the life cycle of writing a proposal, being selected, performing the experiment, writing up the analysis, getting feedback, following up/repeating the experiment, publishing, and going to conferences involved in academia.",

If you jumped on the Julia bandwagon you'll notice that it's dead. If you learned R in 2014 you'll struggle to find a job in 2024.\n\nAI has been around for decades and GPT-2 was released in 2019. If you started with LLM's back then you'd have 5+ years of experience.\n\nYou also need to realize that data scientist is not an entry level role. It assumes a few years of experience (industry or research).\n\nMy suggestion is to focus on the basics and eternal stuff. ML models come and go but model validation, monitoring and scaling hasn't changed since the 2000's."

If you do make sure you have direct access to them so that you don't have to go through someone/dept. Otherwise you'll very likely be caught up at the data gathering stage.\n\n- Do you have any reporting/BI team/colleague? If not then it's probably better approach to start with reporting and dashboard. If your business users aren't comfortable with basic reports/dashboards then your models won't most likely produce any impact. \n\n- Are you comfortable working with web app packages such as Dash, Streamlit, Shiny? in smaller orgs you can create a lot of value  by building web apps to do data manipulation, report automation, simple model/calculation updates etc. I would recommend Shiny + Posit connect subscription. Posit connect will cost some money but that's the quickest way to get value with the lowest effort.\n\nEdit: Training workers isn't worth it unless you are asked to do so.

Keep things as simple, clear, and to the point as possible - most people will stop paying attention when you waffle or get into too much detail. Leave that for questions afterwards. 3.

Use large visuals (graphs, diagrams, maps, etc). Use as little text as possible (nothing is more boring than a slide full of bullet points and sub-bullets). \n- keep the message simple. Drop ALL jargon and explain your model/interpretation with common terms (e.g. most of your audience doesn\u2019t know what \u201cnon-linear decision boundary\u201d means and they probably don\u2019t need to know either).\n- keep it short.

            "Many of us move from programming in Python to programming in PowerPoint. Here is some advice that I often share with people, but do what works for you:\n\n\nGet to the point. It\u2019s not a murder mystery, and if it is it\u2019s Colombo not Sherlock Holmes. Open with your results.\n\nTell people what you\u2019re going to tell them, tell them, tell them what you told them and why it mattered.\n\nManagers love circles and Wingdings(icons) and all that stuff. If you have the displeasure of working with McKinsey, Deloitte, Accenture, etc watch for the way they put together whale decks. Learn to make your stuff look polished and build templates so you don\u2019t have to do it twice.\n\nGet rid of like 90% of the technical content in your presentations. Stick it in the back end. People want to know about money and key results.\n\nPresenting people with a situation, options, and a recommendation and asking for their take is a good idea for a lot of leaders.\n\nStudy your audience, their roles, their background, their social styles if you can find that out. Present to them at their level in their jargon. \n\nIf you get a question, it\u2019s a good idea to phrase it back to the asker, especially for senior leaders.\n\nIf you have junk results open with that and then talk about insights. YMMV, but I\u2019ve had great results with just saying, the model is junk, here is the most compelling thing I found in the project, and something you can do with that.\n\nFrequent updates and communications are a good way to keep projects alive and practice. Find the right level of person to engage with at a given frequency, but treat every update like it\u2019s important. It\u2019s practice and your time is well spent on it.\n\nIf you\u2019re meeting with a director, vice president, a big audience, or someone with a lot of pull, send out your sides as a pre-read two days in advance. It forces you not to be updating the night before, and helps you be ready to present. It also gives your audience the context in advance.

Which tools? What challenges did you face? And so on. In most cases you can talk about those without exposing any specifics. It is annoys sometimes but doable.

            "Since this is cybersecurity the risk of a false negative on the underrepresented class is too high to ignore it. Buffer overflow and root kit attacks can be incredibly damaging, so overlooking them or releasing a model that doesn\u2019t account for them properly is a mistake. \n\nThe first thing I would look at are the features and analyze how similar your underrepresented class features are to the rest of the observations. If they\u2019re very, very dissimilar from the rest of the data set, oversampling to a certain degree should be fine without taking away performance from the other classes. There are lots of different ways to measure similarity, and without knowing what your features looks like my only recommendation is cosine similarity. Visualization would also help make this determination, but if your dataset is too large it becomes more of a pain in the ass that it\u2019s worth. \n\nIf your features are too similar an ensemble approach might be better. One model for your most frequent attacks, with infrequent attacks labeled as \u201cnoise\u201d, and another one for your underrepresented classes with frequent attacks having the noise label. The neat part about this approach is that they validate each other\u2019s findings. The frequent attack model detecting noise and the infrequent model detecting an attack give strong validation for your classification. Additionally, network attacks are by themselves anomalous, so including noise in the models to represent normal operations would be valuable to the business use case if this would eventually be part of some kind of monitoring tool.\n\nIf a single model is an absolute requirement, some further feature engineering to distinguish between the classes would be helpful. For example squaring or cubing numbers that originally seem too close together will allow them to space themselves apart. Be careful with what features you use this on, and make sure you apply the transformation to all observations that have that features. It\u2019s hard to provide any other reco\u2019s beyond that bc I don\u2019t know what your data looks like.",

            "Class imbalance is not usually a problem. The problem comes from incorrect cost function choice!\n\nFor example if you use accuracy but your actual cost function is focused on precision and recall, then of course that will be wrong and you need to undersample/oversample.\n\nBut if you choose the correct cost function for your problem, then class imbalance generally shouldn't be an issue that needs to be directly addressed every time.",
            "This might be a hot take from what the internet suggests, but recently class imbalance has become a maddening topic for me. \n\nGo simulate data and create a bernoulli distribution with a 1% probability, build a classification model and tell me if you have a problem with a 1% target rate.\n\nIf you can actually capture the data generating process, your model will separate the data. I think instead what often happens is we have messy data, see a low target rate, and think it's the target rates fault. So we play around with sampling, but how many times does the model actually perform well back on the full dataset? I typically see that we end up forcing the model to accept a high rate of false positives because we've punished it so much for missing a positive class -- but at that point, we also could have just lowered our classification boundary with our original model.\n\nI'm very open to being wrong here -- just in my experience I haven't seen anyone at my company \"fix\" a class imbalance. The alternatives are often impractical (ex: SMOTE sounds great until you realize how divided the literature is on categorical data distance metrics)."

I'll generally look at loadings on PCA to see if there seem to be underlying latent variables.

Usually I start with some sort of linear model.

            "[deleted]",
            "Couple of thoughts:\n\n1. It depends on the PhD. If you do a PhD focusing in an area of data science that has high demand and low supply, then yes - a PhD is likely going to make you some serious cash.  But if you get a PhD that is either just broadly applicable to DS or where your area of focus doesn't have a ton of industry demand, then whatever pay bump you get will be offset by the fact that you spent an extra 3-5 years in school.\n2. It depends on how you compare it. If you compare \"MS upon graduation vs. PhD upon graduation\", then yes, a PhD will likely start you out at a higher pay grade/role. But if you compare the MS grad + however many years of experience they accumualte while the PhD is in school, then odds are that the MS grad will be ahead in both comp and title at the same point in time. \n3. It also depends on the person. It's hard to compare an MS grad vs. a PhD grad because I would generally expect the average PhD grad to be a better candidate than the average MS grad at the same stage (i.e., upon finishing an MS). That is, you have to be a good MS grad to be accepted into a PhD program. So while there are absolutely MS grads that could ahve gone on to a PhD and that maybe were even smarter than the best PhD candidates (and I have definitely seen cases like this), on average I would argue the PhD grad was likely a better candidate on paper.\n\nAll in all, this is my advice for people thinking of pursuing a PhD:\n\n1. Only do it if you have a very clear idea of what you want to focus on and how that will materialize into a specific industry role. So, for example - maybe you are really interested in A/B testing, and you've had some experience with standard A/B testing and you would like to pursue a career in it. But you don't want to just do basic A/B testing, you want to become an expert is ultra-complex A/B testing and work at Netflix or Facebook, and you see that a lot of people in those teams you want to work on have a PhD in one specific area, so you decide to pursue that. That makes sense. If instead you're just thinking \"oh, people with PhDs probably know more about stats so I just want to know more\", odds are that plan won't have a high ROI.\n2. Only do it if you can get into a program that will elevate your resume. Meaning, if your undergrad, work experience, internships, extracurriculars are level X, then the PhD program that you join needs to be at least level X - and ideally level X+1. So, if you have an undergrad from Stanford and the best PhD program you get into is University of Kansas? Probably not worth it. If your undergrad is from the University of Kansas and you get into a PhD program at Stanford? Hell yeah. \n3. Understand very clearly who your PhD advisor would be, what their track record is for placing students into industry roles, what type of research they do, etc.",
            "I finished my PhD just under a year ago and applied to hundreds of data science jobs. The vast majority wanted either a Masters with 3-5 years experience or a new PhD. I received an offer from one such position that told me my offer was determined by counting my PhD as 4 years of industry experience. If you\u2019ll end up with the same salary after 4 years in industry or a PhD, the math is obviously against the PhD. I think the PhD actually made me a less desirable candidate for these kinds of jobs because they wanted someone who already knew the tech stack, not someone who could learn it. \n\nI also applied for a handful of positions that required a PhD. My PhD is in statistics, and all but one of those positions would only be open to someone in statistics or biostatistics. I\u2019m now happily working in that one exception. Since they value the PhD more than the same amount of industry experience, they pay accordingly. The PhD will probably work out to be a good investment, but I\u2019m also doing different work than I could with a Masters and find the work, autonomy, and culture worthwhile. \n\nIn summary, a PhD is unlikely to pay off unless you\u2019re targeting positions that require a PhD. Even then, you may have to count quality of life improvements to make the math work out in favor of a PhD. I can\u2019t comment on whether the lack of a PhD would be a hindrance to advancement."

That's been a really common friction with our Finance org users in particular who are often needing to download subsets of data from dashboards originally built for the business unit they support. They encounter dashboards that were created to be appealingly visual and easy to monitor all kinds of trends for the business team, but end up hard for the finance users to incorporate into their workflows, which for better or for worse will always involve a lot of Excel.\n\nI just ran into this yesterday trying to download a report from a Tableau view created specifically for exporting data into spreadsheets for non-technical business users. I needed to do a super basic calculation on it that was not part of the dashboard and was going to be much faster to do in Excel than to dig around for the underlying reporting layer table to run the same calc in a notebook. The exported report had all the numeric values encoded as text in Excel (think \"45%\" as a string value rather than 0.45). I tried multiplying that column by 1 in a formula to convert, but for some reason the formula drag down didn't behave as expected and ended up reflecting the same value across all rows even though the formula was dynamic. Didn't have time to troubleshoot that specific issue, so I ended up using Google to find some arcane paste special with multiply by 1 operator solution as a workaround just to convert the damn column into numeric. It left me frustrated both with Excel but also with the dashboard creator for not making sure columns were typed appropriately on the export tab in the first place.",

So if you aren't sure you kinda need to figure that part out.\n\nThere are two main continuums in most tech type roles - people manager vs. individual contributor and technical vs. business side.\n\nGenerally, the technical in data science tends to be deep in research methods, technical details surrounding code and statistical methods, etc. The business side tends to be around dollars whether generated or saved, how to integrate across business functions, and often related to getting an idea into pilot and then into production and it doing what the customer wanted (customers are sometimes internal).\n\nI'd focus your answer around that continuum first. That tends to make the specificity of people manager vs. individual contributor a lot easier. Once you have that answer you can make a quasi-plan and then share that plan with folks when they ask about your career development plan which is what the 3/5 year question is all about.\n\nSo you might see yourself as a project implementation person because you can see the big picture and are learning how all the pieces come together. Or your target might be towards a principal data scientist that is a specialist on model development. It really all depends on what you want.\n\nSo figure out where you go on those continuums and then figure out how to translate that into typical business speak.

            "I manage a research and data science department and also am an extreme introvert by nature. I have a pretty robust professional network that I've built over the past decade working in my current city.\n\nThe thing about \"extrovert\" and \"introvert\" is that these are just natural dispositions. An introvert is capable of making effective presentations, networking, etc. It just may not come as naturally. The way you improve is through practice and persistence, like any skill. \n\nFor any data analyst/scientist, it doesn't matter what you know but how you let other people know what you know. That is, communication is an essential skill. If you can't communicate well to share findings, then you're not as effective as someone who can. It is a very competitive field and employees who can program but not communicate will not advance as far as someone who can do both. Good work does not always speak for itself, particularly when dealing with nontechnical leadership team members. \n\nPersonally, it's something that I've had to work very hard at. And I'm still not the best at networking, presenting, etc. But then, I'm not the best programmer. Or the best manager. And so on. But what makes me marketable is the combination of those skills. You'll never strictly dominate every domain (technical skills, communication skills, leadership skills, domain expertise, etc.). But if you can make yourself competent across the board, then you'll advance. \n\nMy general observation on this and related subs is that too often people focus on acquiring more technical skills. Technical skills are relatively easy to cultivate, so you don't really stand out by mastering them.",
            "I think it's an excellent career for an introvert. I have a maths PhD and work in research (30 years so far). My job has been various modelling and data science projects working with other researchers. I have no interest in climbing any ladder, I enjoy doing a good job and helping make other people successful. Doing this I have got a good reputation and found a good niche. I can do all kinds of things with numbers and data that my non-technical colleagues can't do, and they desperately want to get more knowledge out of their data. With time I gained some self-confidence to give the occasional presentation and it's not too bad. I don't have to be the best presenter. A lot of extroverts give crap presentations anyway. Maybe I benefit from not caring too much.",

But IMO this doesnt have anything to do with introvert vs. extrovert and is more of a skill in itself that is missing. I am also introverted but learned public speaking (with time). In the end, it is an absolutely essential skill and someone who is locked in a room and works flawlessly on a technical level but cant communicate is less useful then someone who might be technically worse but can communicate well."

Should we spend more time debugging the SRM or should we accept the cost and redesign and rerun the experiment. Is there a middle ground here?",

            "Generally yes the test is invalid, but if the observed effect is much larger than the amount of imbalance, you could maybe infer a directional outcome and caveat it appropriately. \n\nIn tech sometimes with overexposures you could filter out the erroneous ones, but that's usually different from SRM/imbalance. \n\nAlso just to make sure--it's ok if the groups are not the same size, it's a problem when they are different sizes than what you expected, which implies the groups may not be heterogeneous.\n\nMight be helpful to get more info on the nature of the test and what weirdness you are seeing.",
            "Sorry for not having a useful comment for you, I\u2019m just curious as to what SRM is? I\u2019ve not heard it in this context before!",
            "Kind of curious..  an adjacent team of mine does a ton of A/B testing via website.  Practically the only measure they look at is conversion.  While volume is similar, the customer makeup can vary in need and geolocation..  This variance in geolocation and customer needs (product type) is ignored completely, though conversion can vary 20% in one location, and even more variance by product type.  How do you account for these variances that we know exist?",
            "So there are a few things you can do that don't require rerunning the test. \n\nFirst you have to know where the mismatch came from. If it's random then there isn't much you can do. \n\nIf it is due to different groups you can do Post-Stratification sampling analyze each segment separately. \n\nIf it is due to different groups sizes then you can use weighting. \n\nFinally you could recalculate your p-value and confidence interval for the new sampling. \n\nIt really depends on your source of the sampling problem and you have to be really careful with how you do all of this as it could easily result in p-hacking."

I started working here after graduating college May of 2022- my degree was in Math and Philosophy. When I started work in October 2022, I was only guaranteed 3 months at the job. I was being paid 15$ an hour for the first month (this was like a onboarding period). Then once I settled, it got increased to 18$ per hour. After the 3 months, I got a further salary bump to 24$ an hour. \n\nThis April (6 months into the job), I negotiated my salary for a raise for the first time. Being my first ever salary negotiation, I feel like I kinda undersold myself. There was a bit of a confusion on the final agreement, but basically my salary was increased to 70k per year (33.65$ an hour).\n\nOverall, I think this is a good salary. Especially when I look at where I was compared to where I am now, and the cost of living in this areas, there\u2019s a lot to be thankful for. As a international student I got really lucky to find a job in the nick of time. But, I\u2019ve done a lot of good work here - in fact I do more Data engineering and software engineering than data science, and I do everything from controls engineering to database management to software development to Statistical analysis.

It was really frustrating: I had taken a whole class, MTH 4230, on linear regressions, but at least in my corner of the renewables industry they profoundly didn't give a single fuck about anything beyond \"best fit line\" and the magical r-squared of 0.8. \n\nAt this point, I'm building out a website that does the analysis I was doing at that job, except I'm doing the math correctly. I will have buttons that show the industry standard methods, of course, but also more innovative views. Instead of gatekeeping with Python (NREL already open sourced what I'm doing-I've already cloned it and follow their github, and usability is a REAL issue) I am doing a full on website with custom stats functions and using D3 (the JavaScript implementation of the Grammar of Graphics ggplot2 is built on) for visualizations. \n\nBottom line? \n\n* For Data Science, subject matter expertise is key. If you don't have it, get it. Read papers, engage with experts, build novel models even if they are useless, etc. \n* For many business use cases, higher ups don't want to hear a word about even slightly sophisticated models. Corporate guardrails are there for a reason, I get that, but I can't live between them. \n\nAll the best and good luck.",

Bayesian modeling package that uses Markov Chains to optimize. Easily productionalized. \n\nThe most important skill for getting to value add in DS is the ability to explain your work to executives. If nobody understands what you\u2019re doing, no high ups will recognize or value your work, and you won\u2019t be trusted to take on / implement a large project.",
            "A lot of the other comments make sense - causal inference, deep learning, Bayesian analysis. These are all great modeling tools to know.\n\nStill, company to company you might end up never using some of those skills - eg in my last role we did a ton of causal inference, but  no DL or Bayesian methods.\n\nI think a more broadly useful set of skills will be ML Ops - being able to deploy an ML model in production. My sense is that more and more DS listings are ML-heavy roles that involve at least some software eng and productionization, so I think ML Ops would help you most on the job market.

Thought I'd share a re-recording of it here\n\n[https://youtu.be/wKH0-zs2g\\_U](https://youtu.be/wKH0-zs2g_U)\n\nThis is the result of a couple weeks of work comparing large data frameworks on benchmarks ranging in size 10GB to 10TB. No project wins. It's really interesting analyzing results though.\n\nDuckDB and Dask are the only projects that reliably finish things (although possibly Dask's success here has to do with me knowing Dask better than the others). DuckDB is way faster at small scale (along with Polars). Dask and Spark are generally more robust and performant at large scale, mostly because they're able to parallelize S3 access. Really-good-S3 access seems to be the way you win at real-world cloud performance.\n\nLooking more deeply at Dask results, we're wildly inefficient. There's at least a 2x-5x performance increase to be had here. Given that Dask does about as well as any other project on cloud this really means that \\*no one\\* has optimized cloud well yet.\n\nThis talk also goes into how we attempted to address bias (super hard to do in benchmarks). We had active collaborations with Polars and Spark people (made Polars quite a bit faster during this process actually). See [https://matthewrocklin.com/biased-benchmarks.html](https://matthewrocklin.com/biased-benchmarks.html) for more thoughts.\n\nThis also shows the improvement Dask made in the last six months. Dask used to suck at benchmarks. Now it doesn't win, but reliably places among the top. This is due to ...\n\n1. Arrow strings\n2. New shuffling algorithms\n3. Query optimization\n\nThere's a lot of work for projects like Dask and Polars to fix themselves up in this space. They're both moving pretty fast right now. I'm curious to see how they progress in the next few months.\n\nFor future work I'd like to expand this out a bit beyond TPC-H. TPC-H is great because they're fairly serious queries (lots of tables, lots of joins) and not micro-benchmarks. We could use broader coverage though. Any ideas?",

Everyone is trying to distinguish themselves from the \"fakers,\" while most companies needs are quite basic.\n\nI've been working on a DS master's degree for a year. I certainly know more than the typical data analyst or self-taught MOOCs student, but I'm overwhelmed by the interdisciplinary nature of the field. I've invested countless hours and thousands of dollars, yet there's a lifetime more to learn. This makes me question whether I want to continue in the field. When I talk to computer scientists, they're all very encouraging and emphasize that, although difficult, everyone can learn to code. When I talk to other data scientists, I get an air of elitism.\n\nI think this happens because data science is a relatively new field. Other specialized skills like accounting, law, or finance have had time to settle into a list of requirements and utilize certifications where necessary. Since we have one title to describe a huge population, people end up getting defensive so they're not grouped together with the less qualified. Maybe overtime this resolves itself as data science expands into more titles. For now, I feel caught between both sides of the argument. I have no desire to get a PhD and a lot of imposter syndrome. It leaves me feeling like I should have gone MBA -> product management and called it a day.  On the flip side, when I explain basic stats at work, I'm met with blank stares, leading me to think the push for Ph.Ds is more about ego than practicality. My hope is to see clearer distinction in titles and more encouragement in the field than discouragement. \n\nFor those of you in the middle like me, where have y'all had success?

This happened partly because I lost a considerable amount of time waiting for clear answers or direction, and also because I made an error when pulling a join together correctly.\n\nThe problem is, I'm always on my own trying to figure things out when handling requests.

I've also noticed a few colleagues who are also newer (although they have more background in data analysis) seem to be doing much better than me when it comes to working independently.

When I get stuck for more than a few hours, I ask my colleagues to point me in the right direction (usually I try looking over different tables/fields, reviewing other analysts working, sitting on things to see if anything clicks).\n5.

            "I'm copying an answer I gave in another subreddit. There are *mathematical* tensors, and then there are tensors as data and computer scientists use the term. There is nearly no relationships between the two uses, so it's very easy for answers to devolve into a bunch of people talking over each other because they aren't familiar with one or the other or both (as you can see in this thread):\n\n----------------\n\nThe word \"tensor\" is overloaded in mathematics, statistics, and computer science. In this context (TensorFlow, and data science more generally), tensor usually just refers to an array of numbers (which may be higher dimensional than a vector or a matrix, which are 1- and 2-tensors, respectively). This is similar to the way that \"vector\" is often used to mean \"a list of numbers\", even though the word has a more technical meaning in mathematics.\n\nThe mathematical meaning is more complex, and is a bit hard to motivate if you're not already working in a field that would have use for them. A high level conceptual view would be that a tensor is a function that eats vectors and spits out a number. These generally arise in situations where you have a space, along with some kind of geometric structure, and the tensors themselves encode some kind of geometric information about the space at each point -- that is, at any point you have a bunch of vectors (which may describe e.g. the dynamics of an object, or some other kind of information), and the tensor takes those vectors and spits out a value quantifying some feature of the space.\n\nOne very common example is given by objects called Riemannian manifolds, which are essentially spaces which locally look similar to Euclidean space, but globally might have a very different structure. At each point, these spaces can be \"linearized\" to look like the vector space Rn, and they come equipped with a dot product that takes two vectors and spits out a number. This dot product in some sense defines the local geometry of the space, since it determines when two vectors are orthogonal, and allows us to define things like the length of a vectors and the angle between two vectors. This \"thing\" is called the metric tensor.",
            "In mechanics - a branch of science studying how bodies deform, the two main variables are stress and strain. The former kind of expresses forces per unit area within the body and the latter expresses the deformation of the body.\n\nSince any physical law has to be formulated in a frame (coordinate system) agnostic way, both are tensors, such that the mathematical formulations are independent of the selected coordinate systems and can be equivalently transformed to any other frame, without changing the description.\n\nIn mechanics we use tensor properties a lot. A lot of models are formulated using tensor invariants (for example pressure is defined as the first invariant of the stress tensor), as well as the rotation formulas (e.g. behaviour of carbon composites is more efficiently defined in a coordinate system aligned with the fibres). I hope you found it relevant.\n\nTL;Dr in physics/engineering tensors are used to formulate relationships that are independent of the selected coordinate system, since definition of a tensor takes care of it",

I had just joined a firm and was assigned to work on improving a model that predicted how likely someone was to respond to our marketing campaigns. The model was trained on a dataset of every prospective customer with ones who have interacted with us being marked as True(likely to respond) and everyone else as False. I tried quite a few things like using different models and creating new features, which did improve the performance, but only marginally. My breakthrough came when I realized that the campaign had been running for long enough that we could just train on the subset of people that had been targeted before, thereby accurately creating the False class (not likely to respond) excluding people who had never been targeted. This instantly gave us a significant uplift in the response rate.\n\nHowever, shortly after we had to reduce funding for the campaign due to budget cuts \ud83e\udd72",

            "There's one thing I came up with at the end of an internship that I was very proud of.\n\nI was working for a software company that is essentially e-bay for car parts suppliers and repairers. Repairers would request a quote and suppliers would essentially bid on that quote. I had the idea of creating an internal Elo rating for the suppliers, based on their successes with bidding.\n\nUnlike chess, which is 1 vs 1, this is 1 vs many. How do you extend the Elo rating maths to a 1 vs many context? I was scratching my head when I realised it's all the same as chemical thermodynamics. (I was a chemist before I became a data scientist). \n\nYou see, the idea and maths that underpins the Elo rating is that the difference between the ratings of two players allows you to calculate the odds of one player winning over the other. The difference between the energies (the Gibbs Free energy to be specific) of two chemical species in solution allows you to calculate the relative concentrations of those two species. The maths for both turns out to be exactly the same, accounting for the scaling factor. So all I needed to do to calculate the Elos of a N-party bid, is just use the maths for the concentration of N chemical species in solution.\n\nThere were a few other tweaks, accounting for multiple bids from the same party, the value of the overall quote (cheaper parts resulted in a smaller correction to Elo after the fact), and a few other things. I then went back and calculated the Elos of every supplier from all of their transactions. \n\nEarlier on in my internship, I had developed a cheap and cheerful linear regression model that helped illuminate what sort of bids repairers chose. When I plugged the Elos into this model, it was the strongest predictor of bidding success.  \n\nThat was just before I left the job. I don't know if they ever did anything with that information.",

Is this normal?\n\nI can read their code and analysis but I just feel isolated and would learn a lot more by actually interacting with them while working\n\nSince joining have learned a lot more about ETL pipelines and cloud technologies, but honestly I\u2019m not sure how much more I can learn here that I can\u2019t learn in any other job.\n\nI can do the work but I feel like I could be a lot more effective and efficient.\n\nDo you just learn by doing in your job?

Prior, I was working as an analyst for a mid-size retailer on their ECommerce team - I was there for a little over a year (this is my only other work experience). Now, I took this role as fully remote (last role was hybrid), and was misled quite a bit in the interview process. I was led to believe that this role was going to be a bit more on the technical side, however I'm learning that isn't the case AT ALL. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nThis new role contains 0 actual data analysis. For starters, I'm the only analyst for this company, so I'm kind of on my own. When I took this job, I flat out told them I was looking for something more technical - in my last role I used some SQL, PowerBI. I was really looking to expand upon that. I have quickly come to realize that the entirety of my role is just responding to tickets and using Adobe Analytics. There is quite literally zero analysis work to be done. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nI'm debating just outright quitting. Nothing makes me feel like I'm in hell more than just sitting there responding to tickets all day. To be clear - I was told that what I'm doing is essentially the job - there won't be expansion into more technical areas in the future. Quite honestly, I feel like I'm regressing by being here, and I feel like my technical skills especially may regress by not being able to utilize them in any way or expand upon them. Maybe I'd focus on getting my Master's, or finding something else - but am I crazy for considering quitting when I'm confident this is a dead-end job that will likely only harm my career more than help?",

I think I have a good intuition into GPs, and they seem incredibly good for modelling non linear data. I know  they have disadvantages as fitting a GP is O(n\\^3) and tunning the hyperparameters is almost an art, but still... why aren't they used more often? the assumptions we make on other regression models don't come into play here, stuff like linear dependency, homoscedasticity, etc... and we get a free uncertainty estimation \"custom\" to each prediction",

GAMs/spline based models wind up accomplishing similar thing for way cheaper. \n\nHowever the following can help make it a bit more tractable if you\u2019re set on GPs - [SVGPs](https://gpflow.github.io/GPflow/2.4.0/notebooks/advanced/gps_for_big_data.html), [Hilbert space GPs](https://youtu.be/ri5sJAdcYHk), sparse approximations (brings it to O(nm^2) for m inducing points)",

Things like gaussian processes, information dynamics, etc. are (imo) too mathematically involved for the average bootcamp data scientist to feel comfortable (or interested in) wrangling. \n\nThat said, my understanding is that they are used in certain areas where advanced time series modeling *is* of key importance. For example, the Ornstein\u2013Uhlenbeck process is often used in mathematical finance and physics.",
            "To correct your assumptions: homoskedasticity is never assumed for linear regressions. Since White (1980), we have had heteroskedasticity-robust inference for more than 40 years. If a textbook claims that it is necessary for some arcane shit (like an estimator being BLUE or some oversimplified formula to be valid), it should be discarded immediately. Linearity is a property of the model imposed by the person creating the model. Non-linear terms (like splines) can be introduced to allow for arbitrary non-linearities in explanatory variables while still retaining linearity in parameters; semi-parametric methods like Robinson\u2019s partially linear model still possess the desirable sqrt(n) convergence of the model parameters. Autocorrelation? Use HAC. Normality and Gaussianity is the *last* assumption that one would be willing to accept. It rules out many phenomena such as observations with unusually high error variance. Normality is usually quite a stretch. Gaussian copul\u00e6 do not perform well in risk modelling.\n\nAs for gaussian processes \u2013 first of all, the kernel has infinite support, which requires some smart trimming to reduce computational time. On a more fundamental level, they are better suited to more predictable and homogeneous phenomena, like solving kinematics problems for a robot arm where the range of rotation is limited and the sensors return quite accurate measurements. In bioinformatics, economics, and other areas with worse data, there is too much uncertainty to impose general Gaussianity. Asymmetry and fat tails are not going anywhere, and most researchers will most likely choose a skew-Student distribution and some asymmetrical reaction to positive and negative past values, and that should be good enough for most applied research."

This might also be a thing specific to the fact that I'm in a research role, but my schedule is pretty dynamic and flexible. In other words, so long as I am working those 40 hours and attending any scheduled meetings, I can essentially work on my own schedule which is awesome.\n\nI also work fully remotely which is quite nice and am given access to numerous powerful computational resources. I also really like my supervisor and the rest of the team. People are generally very nice, welcoming and they really care about the work that they are doing.\n\nThe one downside is that even though I get paid well I know that I could certainly be making a lot more in the private sector. I can't complain too much since I definitely make more than enough to pay all my bills, save, and enjoy myself. Also, the job is RIDICULOUSLY stable. I haven't had to worry about layoffs ever, even in the midst of all the layoffs that have been happening across tech. If anything, I was basically told that my position was pretty secure for the next 9 years because of the grant that my position is designated under.",

        "content": "TL;DR: Took my first DS job, was moved to a software development team and now I'm stuck, because my current job doesn't give me the experience I need to move to the next DS gig.\n\nSo, I started my first job as a generalist DS ~1.5 yrs ago (following an unrelated PhD), but after ~6 mo, the company pulled a bait-and-switch and \"temporarily\" moved me to a software development project due to a \"shift in priorities\" and because I \"know Python\". \n\nNow it's been a year and I still find myself in a scrum team fixing bugs, adding features to our app or wireframing UIs. Naturally, I've been looking for a new DS position, but without much success, i.e. few take-homes or technical interviews.\n\nThe main hurdles, in my view, are that\n\u2022 Interviewers get suspicious when they see that I've been at my current company for such a short amount of time,\n\u2022 I've gained virtually no experience directly relevant to DS (only worked on a data pipeline / reporting project for the first few months).\n\nTo address the first issue, I usually give a canned response, when asked about my motivation to move. I would say that I've been working in a software development project because it creates the most value for the company at this time. That I really appreciate this experience because good development practices and cloud technologies are so important for modern DS workflows, but that I prefer working more hands-on with data to solve concrete problems for stakeholders. In my view, that's quite positive and logical, but maybe this could be improved?\n\nThe experience issue is harder to fix. The only way I see atm is to go back to doing personal projects and applying to entry-level jobs. Since I don't have the energy for this while working full time, I'd have to save up for a few months and then quit my current job. That carries a certain risk, but I'd bite the bullet for a chance at a job that's more up also. Is there anything I should keep in mind before I do this?",

Embrace Python + dig deeper into SWE. \n\nI swear, it'll come together later in a future job.. maybe you'll productionize ML models, and suddenly be the superstar DS who codes well too. \n\nOr maybe you join an early-stage startup where they need a DS who can also code well too.",

My org is pretty new to the whole digital transformation thing so I assumed my switch into dev was because they need more infrastructure help.. and I don't mind it for the time being because the dev type projects still integrate a little machine learning but dang... I would not wanna be stuck fixing bugs... wth... what about a part time contracting gig in ML? Maybe go to a few networking events and see if you can talk to someone about gaining experience?",
            "I would love for the opportunity to flesh out my DS skills with some Dev work. I feel quite limited by being mainly a python scripter and analyst atm. SE and dev really opens up a lot of employment opportunities, for real. Unless you're wanting to carve out your own eyeballs doing this type of thing, I'd embrace the experience. Also ... Seems extremely common to be bait and switched unfortunately. Often a team might want some kind of unicorn with a bit of everything they're missing, and then the recruiter or hiring person that made the job description just doesn't capture that, so they are after \"someone who codes and is reasonably smart\" that they can slot in. I see plenty of job postings asking for something like a \"machine learning engineer\" that has expectations you're more than just a data scientist, and would have a hand in ETL, APIs, reporting/processing pipelines. \n\n\nThe easiest way to fix the first issue (suspicion about why you're leaving the role so soon) is to simply be there longer. Your expressed motivation is fine in terms of framing it as a positive, but if I were interviewing, unfortunately I would probably think \"Ah ok, so by this person has found their groove in the team, they might have decided they're bored and want to move on.\" It takes a while for DS people at my current job to find their stride, usually takes 6months to a year of learning/connecting, so it's a waste if they don't seem likely to stick around.\n\n\nAs to the 2nd issue, actively hunting for roles is not trivial from a time and energy perspective. You could be using that time for scoping out DS projects to keep your edge, or even scope out projects at work.\n\n\nFinally... Who have you spoken to at work regarding this concern? There's this faceless The Company who has bait and switched you, but there's a million and one polite ways to express that you'd like to do something else. If you've been on the Dev team for a year and have been doing a good job there, why would they know that's not what you want? Case in point, I myself would be all \"cool, this is new, I'll do this for a bit\", but you're clearly not. Does anybody know?"

The company doesn't own any products but rather takes a commission from every product sold.\n\nYou have access to a table of 500 such products (for Paris only) that has columns like title, category, review count, review avg, price, duration, when it was posted, etc... (maybe 2-3 more but these seem more like internal IDs that don't really matter). The three questions we went over before she gave up on me were:\n\n1. How would you pick 1-2 metrics from this column to sort these listings? (To build a quick formula for ranking these listings)\n2. What are some disadvantages of this approach?\n3. How would you predict that the rankings will change in 6 months from today (assuming I implemented my strategy)?\n\nMy answers where:\n\n1. I would pick the review avg and count. normalize the count, like minmax so that it is in the same range as the review avg, and weight the review count and review avg by a alpha and (1 - alpha) for example. Should have I picked price instead of review count? I didn't because I would assume that the revenue generated per product would be somewhat similar (I also asked how they take commission and the answer I got was to use price as the proxy for commission which imo makes no sense, the rates wouldn't be the same for all of the prices right?), otherwise they would not have signed that product plus, for longer term growth I would assume UX would be more important that money generated short term, i.e. recommend things that the user would like more... should have I used the inverse of the review count to treat this problem more like a multi armed bandit with the UCB strategy?\n2. I said that this approach wouldn't give a higher ranking to newer products and that it would be more dificult for these new products to rank\n3. I pretty much said the same as 2. because I also gave up around here\n\nThe questions I have are: why ask a question that doesn't allow me to use ML? I understand having a baseline, but still... I briefly mentioned multi armed bandits and she overlooked what I said. If this was a business case why didn't I get more context? I asked what was the bigger context, if this was for a ranking algorithm, and got a not very convincing \"sure\" (tbh using the term \"sort\" here somewhat confused me, I usually see the term \"ranking\" for these problems, it looked like she was avoiding it for some reason).

Is it affecting only user with any specific platform (desktop or app...)?\n\nAssuming the aim was trying to improve user experience for all platforms, so the hot or relevant experience should be on top, depending on the searched words. So it's assumed the goal is to improve the relevancy algo. In this case, \"hot\" experience can be defined as the combination of matching title and good avg reviews, weighing against the price. Disadvantage: avg reviews need some times to collect, also needs to filter fradulent reviews. The ranking can be changed in the future depends on new competitors joining, category competitiveness, seasonality (travel season, price ....) so this is something to consider in the model.  \n\nBasically, different goals have different approaches.",

As a business being able to work out what products are making you the most, or costing you the most is important. Your ranking algorithm needs to help sort that. So price/revenue \\* frequency is a good starting place\n2. Here you can talk about the flaws in the assumptions you make, eg if you're using review frequency as a proxy measure of frequency, that it might be oversampling the ends of the distribution, and undersampling the middle.\n3. What happens in 6 months for tourism? Well you go from summer to winter, or winter to summer. So a bunch of touristy activities that may be very popular in summer would drop down to 0 during winter and vice versa.\n\nFrom 3 you can kick off that you'd use frequency of dates of purchase, redemption or booking of activity as a proxy measure for when that activity takes place to see if you can generate at the very least, whether an activity is a summer one, winter one, or invariant to time.  \n\n\nAs a business I'd love to know with data which things we're recommending that are doing well all year round, and which ones we should advertise/promote seasonally.  \n\n\nThe key thing I think you missed in this interview is that data science is about helping solve business problems by using the data you have available (or working out how to get more). To solve business problems you still need a working mental model of how that data is generated.\n\nAs a scientist in general, you build a mental model of how you think something will behave, and then you conduct experiments to attempt to falsify that model. As a data scientist in that instance, my mental model is that many of these activities are seasonal, and the temporal component of them will play a large role as to their profitability. The experiment I conduct to verify that is to pull out the data I do have available to be able to give each activity it's temporal variability score, then make a bubble plot of each activity with it's price, frequency and temporal variability.\n\nWith that I can present to my key stakeholders something they can visually grasp and understand which gives them a clear picture of what type of partnerships they should pursue with different activity providers and which ones they could potentially drop.\n\nBest part is I'll build this to be entirely automatic so now the key stakeholders can check it whenever they want."

There are vendors available, such as Fivetran or Portable, that have pre-built connections that they manage.\n\nHere are two examples of ELT/ETL in action.\n\nETL:\n- Your organization is starting to have more questions about about historical trends and patterns of your data.\n- Currently, the org only has a transactional database (OLTP) for the product, and running these heavy analytical queries runs the risk breaking the transactional database for the product.\n- Thus, you decide to replicate the data on an database designed specifically for analytics (OLAP) to power these heavy queries while not risking the production transactions database.\n- You build an ETL pipeline to replicate data from the transactional database to the analytical database, including some data transformations to make it easier to use.\n\nELT:\n- Your organization purchases third party data from a vendor to supplement your organization's data.\n- While this third party data is useful, the vendor provides extremely messy tables.\n- Since this data is for R&D purposes, there is no defined business logic available.\n- Therefore, you deem its okay to dump this data into a data lake and give the data science team access to explore.\n- You build an ELT pipeline that extracts the raw data from the third party vendor and loads it into the data make.\n- After a few iterations, the data science team has determined which parts of the data are valuable, and build data transformations on top of the data in the data lake for their workflows.\n\nHope this helps!",

            "Yeah that's pretty much all there is to ETL. It is just extract, transform, load. Each step of that sequence can obviously be as complex as you would like it to be and directed towards what you want it to.\n\nETL is not some fancy software, it is literally just a design pattern for moving and transforming data. You can make an ETL pipeline in the kid language Scratch if you want to.\n\nAmazon explains it pretty well and they are also interested in people understanding the material, not stroking some professor ego.\n\n[https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/big-data/etl-and-elt-design-patterns-for-lake-house-architecture-using-amazon-redshift-part-1/](https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/big-data/etl-and-elt-design-patterns-for-lake-house-architecture-using-amazon-redshift-part-1/)",
            "I'm a former data scientist who now mostly works with data engineering stuff. We use Databricks.

            "There's a couple of examples here (as well as some people who shouldn't have commented lol), but here's an extremely practical example and extremely high level overview of how we use ETL at my healthcare company.\n\nEvery hour we receive a huge pile of HL7v2 messages (healthcare standard) from our various partners. These get dumped (basically raw with some attached metadata) into some tables, because you gotta store them somewhere. They are extraordinary difficult to use in these tables. We have a batch ETL pipeline that does the following:\n\n1) EXTRACTs the new HL7v2 messages from these tables.  \n2) TRANSFORMs the data by parsing apart the message, identifying what type of message it is, mapping the HL7v2 fields to the appropriate fhir fields, running some consistency checks and fuzzy-matching & other logic to align our business' internal customer identifiers (i.e if John Doe, John C. Doe, J. Doe all have the same date of birth and same address, they're probably the same customer. If John C. Doe and John C. Doe have the same d.o.b. and the same point-of-sale but the address changed, it's probably the same customer who moved, etc). This is done for customers, observations, encounters, diagnoses, etc. to ensure the data is as internally-consistent as we can get it.  \n3) LOAD the data into our fhir store with the appropriate mappings and identifiers.\n\nAt this point, we have *another* similar-ish ETL pipeline that takes the data out of the fhir store and massages it into some flattened tables for ease of querying. This final landing is where the analyst/scientist/ML Ops can pick up the data for use for whatever jobs they have to do, be it dashboarding, exploratory modeling, or pipelining into production models."

We are screening very fine applicants from China, India, Turkey, etc.\n\nThat said, I do wonder where all the native English-speaking American data scientists are at?

            "Interesting. I'm from the US and a native English speaker with a PhD and constantly rejected from all the DS roles I applied to over the years. The only time I had a DS title was after the org went through restructuring of everyone's titles, and I moved from DA to DS (though the duties my boss wanted me to perform were not DS at all..). All the DA titles I had, no matter what actual work I did, is probably the reason for all the rejection - I get it; a lot of automatic rejection based on that.\n\nAll that aside, I think business acumen, speaking to stakeholder groups, and presenting results clearly would be important for both DS and advanced DA roles, but that likely depends on the company and what jobs they actually need done at the time of hiring. Also, I've worked with plenty of DS from the US who are native English speakers and terrible communicators! So being a native English speaker definitely does not make you a great communicator/presenter automatically...",
            "I see a pretty similar trend when I screen resumes.\n\nIn general, the brightest American kids are going into high paying jobs in law, finance, medicine, consulting, and tech.  All straight out of undergrad or the required professional school.\n\nOf those going into tech, the easiest path is just doing SWE because it doesn't require grad school, and if you're good at it, offers equal or higher pay and more flexibility than DS.\n\nSo basically, if you're American and you're generally talented and have technical chops, there are easier and more lucrative options than shlepping it as a data guy.  Those options also tend to reward communication ability, which is easier as a native English speaker, so you have less competition from foreigners.\n\nThe diversity of your applicant pool is also a function of the kind of company you are.  Young hip startup --> probably more Americans.  Old boring enterprise company (which is more likely to sponsor visas, crucially) --> probably more foreigners.",

For most companies, the return on investment for data science teams is far lesser than a team of data analysts and data engineers working on a business problem. In some orgs, data scientists are now being seen as resource hoggers, some of who have extremely high salaries but haven't delivered anything worthwhile to make a business impact or even to support a business decision.\n\nOther than a few organizations that have been successful in hiring the right talent and also fostering the right ecosystem for data science to flourish, it seems that most companies still lack data maturity. While all of the companies seem to have a \"vision\" to be data-driven, very few of them have an actual plan. In such organisations,  the leadership themselves do not know what problems they want to solve with data science. For the management it is an exercise to have a \"led a data team\" tag in their career profiles. \n\nThe expectation is for the data scientists to find the problems themselves and solve them. Almost everytime, without a proper manager or an SME, the data scientists fail to grasp the business case correctly. Lack of business acumen and the pressure of leadership expectations to deliver on their skillsets, makes them model the problems incorrectly. They end up building low confidence solutions that stakeholders hardly use. Businesses then either go back to their trusted analysts for solutions or convert the data scientists into analysts to get the job done. \n\nThe data scientists are expected to deliver business value, not PPTs and POCs, for the salary they get paid. And if they fail to justify their salaries, it becomes difficult for businesses to keep paying them. When push comes to shove, they're shown the door. \n\nData scientists, who were once thought of as strategic hirings, are now slowly becoming expendables. And this isn't because of the market conditions. It is primarily because of the ROI of data scientists compared to other tech roles. And no, a PhD alone does not generate any business value, neither does leetcode grinding, nor does an all-green github profile of ready-made projects from an online certification course the employee completed to become job ready. \n\nBut here's the problem for someone who has to balance between business requirements and a technical team - when evaluated on the basis of value generated, it does not bode well with the data science community in company, who feel that data science is primarily a research job and data scientists should be paid for only research, irrespective of the financial and productivity outcomes.\n\nIn such a scenario, how should a data scientist be evaluated for performance?\n\nEDIT: This might not be the case with your employer or the industry you work in.",

I did stats/applied math in college and worked as a BI engineer beforehand so that helped building up the cross-functional skills.\n\nThere's a lot of compromises . You're gonna be stretched thin from a skills-building perspective and its gonna take longer to hit career and comp milestones.

For the heavy Stats, ML Engineers usually know enough to do modeling the average Data Analyst would struggle with. Many Data Scientists complain about not doing actual 'science' but quick and dirty analyses, sometimes even in Excel, but are often not able to deliver / deploy a model themselves.

What is the mathematical law X follows ?*\n\nMy answer : Uniform law, with probability of p=1/n => p=1/2 here.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n*2) Now I call Y the random variable counting the number of times I get heads. What is the mathematical law Y follows ?*\n\nMy answer : Binomial law => succession of experiences with 2 outcomes.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n*3) You have a dataset with equal amounts of pictures of cats, dogs, and a third categories with all but cats and dogs, all in quantity sufficient to prevent issues. We build a model achieving 95% precision. But, when entering production, the precision collapses to 60%. What do you do to fix this ?*\n\nMy answer : I would take the data from production, and analyse both training and production datasets to look for statistical differences, labelization mistakes, or any property which could explain a difference (example : maybe all cats and dogs are black in the training one ?). I would also check the capacity of the model, look for any underfitting or overfitting issue, by looking at the loss of the model on seen and unseen data.  I would also make sure data was shuffled properly, just in case.\n\nOther things to do would be to check confusion matrixes to help identify the cases of the errors.\n\n*4) Give me key indicators of performance in data science.*\n\nFor neural networks construction, training precision/loss, validation precision/loss, testing precision/loss, but also statistical indicators like RSE, RMSE, MAPE... and the dozen of similar metrics. Each of those metrics have different use case, for example RMSE is good for low values in dataset, but bad for high values or outliers.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n4 days later, I received an email telling eventhough the interview was pleasant and my career impressive, I made mistakes on those questions which made them decide to not continue the hiring process with me.

This type of clarification is useful in general and can help avoid situations where you have made potentially incorrect assumptions.

What does the company gain from having you hired? What is the data science brining to the table? No one cares about your loss functions outside of your team. \n\nSo my notes would probably be. Not nailing theoretical questions and underwhelming  answer on solving modelling issues and lack big picture perspective. \n\nNow, you compare this with the other 20 candidates you have interviewed and I can tell you that a lot of people don't really answer these questions that good.

When there is an instant collapse between dev and production, it could also be data engineering issue (maybe the way the images are read are different etc ...).\n\n4) Question is a bit vague, but those aren't KPI, those are loss functions. KPI should be more business focused. Accuracy, Precision, Recall are one step higher, and you could probably even go one notch higher (money save, time spent save, cost save, profit increase ...)\n\n&#x200B;\n\nOverall, **I** would say **from your answers** that you lack experience and lack perspective."

January was also the time when chatGPT was getting popular and I had been playing around with chat-with-your-data apps using the openai LLMs. So on a whim, even before deciding anything, I created an Upwork profile. Mostly, I wanted to prove to myself that i could make money if i needed to without selling away all my time to a company.\n\nI reached out to a couple of folks on Upwork who needed help with AI chatbots, and to my surprise, within a couple of weeks, i had my first freelancing gig and soon after (thanks to the upwork algorithm), started getting jobs in my inbox. So much so that I could select what jobs i wanted to work on. Just last week, I declined a $10k contract offer just for the first phase as the client had been dragging their feet since March with \"approvals\" and the scope was unclear. I had to remind myself that i didn't want to get into another long contract which would effectively be full time employment.\n\nSince Feb, I have made $15k on Upwork without really 'applying' for any of them (all inbound requests), while being highly selective on how much time i freelance and what kind of work i want to do. I know $15k is nothing to brag about compared to a salary, but I share this as someone who 4 months back, thought freelancing was a non-option for me. To the person who asked about this yesterday, it's very doable.\n\nSo what have I been doing with the rest of my time? Spending time with my now 6-month son, traveling, and learning web development. Work-wise, I wanted to reconnect with fellow data scientists, so tried running a data science mentoring/mock interview group here but that never really took off ([https://www.reddit.com/r/datascience/comments/10uy2qi/starting\\_a\\_personalized\\_mentorship\\_group\\_for\\_data/](https://www.reddit.com/r/datascience/comments/10uy2qi/starting_a_personalized_mentorship_group_for_data/)).  So instead, I combined it with my other interest to learn web development and have built a data science mock interview app - [rightjoin.co](https://rightjoin.co). here is a short blurb-\n\n* get mock interviewed with an AI hiring manager for any company/job post/topic of choice. Warm up for your upcoming interview with questions tailored to the job posting/topic.\n* you can upload your resume and have your AI persona answer questions for you. so you get to observe how your chatGPT-version would answer questions.\n* get feedback on each response to the interviewer questions\n\nIts currently a \"phone-screen\" level interview, but i plan adding other types of interview rounds if people find this useful. And its free. please try out and let me know what you think, especially if you have an upcoming interview. here's a screenshot:\n\n[tailored mock interview by an imaginary hiring manager \\(https:\\/\\/rightjoin.co\\/\\)](https://preview.redd.it/hzycr666rc3b1.png?width=2158&format=png&auto=webp&s=f7b061ce1255bae7df74bdf6ecb0aa778e442579)\n\nFor me, it's been fun dabbling with web development (django, htmx), keeping up with AI wave, having the freedom to spend time with family when i feel like, and learn things that interest me. I know this may not be sustainable, but I do plan to ramp up freelancing later this year if needed to stress test that option, and only in the worst case, jump back into the job market.\n\nI understand, these options may not be viable for others, but if you do find yourself having to make additional income with freelancing or want to try out solopreneurship, it's possible.

I stand before you, not to criticize, but to call for a revolution of truth in the hotels of Mexico. When we browse through the online galleries of Booking.com, we're met with images that paint a picture of paradise, but reality often falls short.\n\nI say to the hotel owners of Mexico: let us be transparent in our offerings. Let the pictures on the websites reflect the truth, for false promises only lead to shattered expectations. We must rise above the allure of deceptive visuals and embrace the power of honesty.\n\nWe cannot ignore the call for better service in every aspect. It is unacceptable for guests to endure disruptions in the quietude of night because an employee indulges in a YouTube video with maximum volume. Our pursuit of excellence should extend to every corner of hospitality, from the plush beds to the courteous staff.\n\nAnd then, there's the matter of the beach, once envisioned as a pristine haven. Today, it lies besieged by seaweed, a stark contrast to the idyllic scenes we've been sold. Let us reclaim the authenticity of our shores and restore the natural beauty that drew travelers in the first place.\n\nAs I speak, I cannot ignore the pungent smell that sometimes wafts through the air. It's a reminder that even amidst challenges, we have the power to transform. Let us commit ourselves to a hospitality that not only meets but exceeds expectations, leaving our guests with memories that resonate with the true essence of Mexico.\n\nSo, let honesty prevail, let service be a beacon of excellence, let our beaches reclaim their allure, and let the fragrance of hospitality be one that lingers in the hearts of all who visit. Together, we can build a future where truth is the foundation, and our hotels stand as paragons of genuine, unforgettable experiences.",

        "comment counts": 26,
        "content": "How important are computer science (CS) fundamentals to data science roles   at tech companies? And how central are they to the application  process?\n\nTech companies like  Google, Meta, and Amazon offer public resources to help  job candidates understand work life and required skills. These resources  often  describe cross-functional teams of engineers, data scientists,  etc.  Advertised roles like \"machine learning engineer\" also seem to  inhabit  the gray area between software development engineer (SDE) and  data  scientist. Of course, these companies offer tech products at huge scale, and at least for SDEs, CS knowledge is a focus.\n\nHowever,   many data science learning materials focus on the math and techniques for analyzing data and building models, with programming as essentially a  means to those ends.\n\nAs  someone  interested in exploring tech, I am wondering if formal study of  data  structures, algorithms, computational complexity, etc., should be  a  bigger part of my diet.\n\nI appreciate your answers. It's helpful to know your connection to this topic too (e.g., recruiter, team member, fellow candidate).\n\n**EDIT:** I take it for granted that folks need to know how to write maintainable code and use programing tools like git, unit tests, etc. By CS fundamentals I am thinking of concepts or design patterns that enable software to scale efficiently. Thanks for clarifying questions.\n\n**UPDATE:** Thanks for all the input. To summarize several great comments drawing from individual professional experience:\n\n> Data Scientists (DS) and ML Engineers (MLE) need different skills; generally these roles are not interchangeable. Large companies may be able to specialize so that DS focus on models and collaborate with MLE for scaling. Smaller companies may have more generalists. CS knowledge requirements may also vary by different areas of a company (e.g., product vs engineering).\n>\n> A DS with CS knowledge may collaborate better and enjoy more career mobility. However, entry level DS can generally begin with rudimentary CS knowledge and grow on the job.\n\nCouple follow-ups for those who want more:\n\n- The hiring guides I mention focus more on SDE. Seen any good ones for DS?\n- I feel like I see more MLE than DS reqs. How does demand compare?",

            "Depends on the company/role, but generally they\u2019re considered pretty darn important. They\u2019re particularly important if you\u2019re working in a highly collaborative environment, building models to be put into production, or if you\u2019re dealing with really large scale and response time is important.\n\nIf you\u2019re more on the experimentation/causal inference/product analytics side of things they\u2019re less important, but still good to know.",
            "In big tech there are often dedicated MLOps and engineers who handle scaling, deployments, etc. so actually these skills can become a little less important for data scientists. I think it is most important for data scientists building production code in startups or non-tech companies who can't be as specialized because they need to handle more parts of the process. Of course, with many exceptions.\n\nI am a DS lead who writes production code and have conducted maybe 150 DS interviews for candidates of different levels and backgrounds. I am also involved with talent evaluation, mentoring, and standards settings / job descriptions at enterprise level.\n\nNow, do you really need to know algorithms and data structures in an academic CS sense? No, but being able to write code effectively as part of a team (classes and functions that others can easily understand and use, proper testing, etc.) design solutions, spec an API, lay out and document schemas and data contracts, etc. can be very valuable.",
            "What are you defining as \u201cCS fundamentals\u201d? A DS at a company like that needs be very good at SQL and scripting in Python or R, while not necessarily needing a full SWE skillset.\n\nAs for MLE roles, at big tech companies like thenones you mentioned that\u2019s often literally a SWE role, you\u2019re just expected to also be exceptionally good at applied Machine Learning. Other companies might play it more loose with that title, just like they might be more loose with a DS title.\n\nSource: I\u2019m a DS in tech who commits code for ML deployments but I don\u2019t consider myself to have all the same skills as a SWE",
            "Usually entry level DS roles do not require extensive swe knowledge. However it is a great way to distinguish yourself. And it becomes more and more relevant the more mature (w.r.t. data science and Ai applications) the company is. I.e once an organisation moves use cases to production. \n\nIt is (at least in Europe) a big problem for a lot of companies that have very data scientists who are very capable in modeling and statistics bit fail with the swe practices. \n\nSo if you don\u2019t want to stay within a pure data analyst role where you answer business intelligence questions on static datasets in notebooks or scripts, swe skills are very relevant. They are however usually not required for entry level positions.",
            "On a basic level, knowing how to use git commands and building classes in your code is a great way to get started. Data Structure and Algorithm is needed for some interviews, and for DS roles they're primarily 'easy' in terms of difficulty. MLE roles however are treated like Software Engineering roles, and they anticipate robustness in terms of development skills and experience in deploying production-level code/model."

            "Is it worth it; \nyes if your actually go page by page, read it, actually wrote the code out, understand it and apply yourself. Does it have everything? No. As a data scientist, you really should focus on learning how to learn not memorizing everything; know when and how to use something rather than memorizing something you may never use. Knowing statistical things exist and that you can look them up as needed is incredibly important though. It\u2019s ok to not know things.\n\nHow to read it? \n100% up to you; I suggest reading it from cover to cover, doing the code, maybe no more than an hour a day at a time. After each chapter, write the top 3 most important things down. At the end of the book pick the top 1 from each chapter and write it down in the cover of the book, then when needed just reference the front cover as a refresher.\n\nI think the final two questions you have asked have been answered in my other remarks.\n\nRead with purpose. Take notes with purpose. Know the why behind why the author wrote this; understand why it has value, then practice putting that value to work.\n\nGood luck and enjoy the read.",
            "It's just a field handbook. Dip into the relevant section as needed.\n\nIt's good enough to get that very short term business problem fixed (like replacing a flat tire with Spinifex is a fix) but you'll really need more depth in order not to drop a clanger.\n\nEven the references are just to introductory books.\n\nFor a reasonable introduction to stats for data science that won't lead you to shoot yourself in the foot, I swear by \"Statistical rethinking\".\n\n\n\nDeeply Bayesian, but the thought processes it teaches are top notch.\n\nOh. Free PDF and there are videos of lectures to go with the book, along with suggested pathways.",
            "I finished this book recently. Imo is a good well written book. Do not expect it to dive deep into ML and statistical concepts. However it gives you a good overview of the algorithms and their pros and cons, which is enough to arouse your curiosity. \n\nIt is important to be aware of the methodologies and the available tools, although you might not understand them 100%. You know that they exist, so next time you face a problem you could come up with a solution easier.",
            "It's a good book, and I'd recommend it. It makes a nice reference or primer.\n\nIt is worth it, but it doesn't have everything, but most of what is needed most of the time.\n\nI read it cover to cover with some code notes, it isn't a long book and not difficult if you have any stats knowledge.\n\nI do make code notes as others aren't needed, but if your stats are weak it might be worth making some notes.\n\nIMO, you should get a strong understanding of the book and then refer to it as you forget some parts you seldom use. \n\nAll that being said, it isn't a replacement for a good stats textbook. I like Freedman, but he is dated a bit. Someone else mentioned Wasserman, also good, also a bit dated, but either can give you a math understanding of stats, though they aren't much to code with on their own. For newer, Modern Statistics by Kenett I've heard is good but haven't used it."

One example was a mixed-integer program for medical staff scheduling, solved using branch-and-bound (which uses LP). The solvers will take care of the algorithm for you, so that all you need to know is how to program the model and retrieve/interpret the results. Problems that require more advanced optimization techniques very frequently use LP as part of the solution strategy, but you will have to write your own code for that. \n\nI could write a screed about how under-utilized LP is, but the main idea is this: \n\nWhenever you need to make a decision (which every organization does hundreds of times per day), you need to use the tools of operations research. Optimization modeling (linear, non-linear, stochastic, dynamic, integer, and others) or simulation are basically the only way to do that at an industrial scale. Any large corporation that has an institutionalized decision support system will use one or probably several of those techniques. Dashboards, predictive models, and subject matter expertise are all useful, but they are all going to lead to sub-optimal decisions (edit: if used without an optimization model or simulation).\n\nJust my two cents.",

I\u2019ve been productizing models for a few years and it does a good job of summarizing the stack.\n\nOtherwise, as a first step, try to build a toy model, save it to AWS S3, and use the UI to click around and write up a Lambda Function that reads the model into memory and returns the output. Those are the very basics of deployment, done the quick and dirty way.",

There's also [MLOps Community](https://mlops.community/), which has a Slack, and Chip Huyen's [ML Ops Discord](https://discord.com/invite/Mw77HPrgjF), which I think is about to do a book club on Chip's book [Designing ML Systems](https://www.amazon.com/Designing-Machine-Learning-Systems-Production-Ready/dp/1098107969). Oh and r/mlops.",
            "I'd split it into a few things:\n\n**Some good resources first that I've used to start:**  \nFundamentals of Data Engineering by Joe Reis, Hands-On Machine Learning with Scikit Learn, Keras and Tensorflow by Geron.\n\n**Key concepts to start:**  \nFocus on understanding the lifecycle of machine learning models (from dev to prod), continuous integration and deployment (CI/CD) pipelines, monitoring and maintenance of models in production, and the DE necessary to prepare and manage data at scale.  \nFor MLOps: Learn about model versioning, experiment tracking, model deployment, and monitoring. Familiarize yourself with platforms like MLflow, Kubeflow, and TensorFlow Extended (TFX).  \nFor Data Engineering: Focus on basic ETL (Extract, Transform, Load) processes, data warehousing, and data pipelines. Tools and frameworks like Apache Spark, Apache Airflow, and cloud data services (AWS Glue, Google Cloud Dataflow) are good to learn for big data.\n\n**Building**  \nPretty much any project that involves the end-to-end lifecycle of a machine learning model. This could include building a model, deploying it using a tool like Docker, and setting up a simple pipeline with Jenkins.",
            "These are just special cases of software engineers.\n\nData engineering is basically SQL, Pyspark and DBA duties with some cloud sprinkled in. The 2000's style writing performant data pipelines age using map reduce in Scala while earning 200k/y are long gone. It's just SQL on top of some data warehouse tool and the pay is shit compared to the good ol' days.\n\nML Engineering is all about turning jupyter notebooks and csv files into a working ML system. Usually scheduling it as a batch job. It can be just learning Airflow and saving that notebook as a .py and scheduling it/rewriting the damn thing in Pyspark or it can be rewriting everything in Kotlin or Swift and making it work on a phone in real-time without eating the battery or burning a hole in your pants. Mostly the former though.\n\nMLOps engineering is basically DevOps but for ML. It can be super simple like installing Kubeflow and MLFlow for data scientists and ML engineers to use or it can be architecting and engineering an internal ML platform with AutoML features so you can make production ML models using SQL or clicking a button in an UI.\n\nThe answer on \"how\" is to get a degree in computer science (or equivalent knowledge on your own) and learn about system design, webdev, DevOps, Cloud etc. while not forgetting the data, stats or ML side. The key is knowing the basics of basically everything related to software systems and going deep on the ML/Data specific stuff.\n\nMost people I know in the field are CS people/software engineers with an interest in ML/Data and they learned all of this in school/at work before getting into ML. Very rarely it's the other way.",

Just iterating over a million different models won't give you an automatic solution.\n\nSomeone suggested Arima - you can try neural prophet as it has ARNET implementation that will capture it if it exists and it will be relatively fast for you to switch after prophet.\n\nYou can also try out pycaret timeseries module\n\nNext step - autogluon",

They can either click \"like\", \"dislike\" or not give feedback at all.\n\nThe goal is to maximize the probability that a client would enjoy the song, by matching a song based on the info we have on the user (the features I mentioned before).\n\nIntuitively I was thinking of a multiclass classifier, but I have only like/dislike (or no feedback) for one song per user (assume I don't know who the user is, I treat each observation as independent).\n\nAnother way is to create an XGBOOST for each one of the 10 songs, and in real-time choose the song with the highest prediction. It'd work but it sounds \"dumb\", as there is a much better, known way, to deal with it. Is that correct?",

Aside from the salary difference there are a lot of other things we have to pay for in the US that is much cheaper or included in your taxes in the UK, like healthcare.   \n  \nAnother factor that may explain the salary differences are market pressures. US companies have to compete with the big tech companies for employees which helps drive up wages.\n\nEdit: As [this article](https://www.investopedia.com/ask/answers/100214/what-cost-living-difference-between-us-and-uk.asp) points out you are better off comparing cities. There\u2019s a big difference if you\u2019re comparing London to San Francisco CA vs Orlando FL. Salaries, and most costs, in Florida are generally lower than California, even when accounting for the difference in state income taxes.",
            "$100k is the exception for juniors, not the rule. It\u2019s much more likely to make $60k for entry level analyst and maybe $80k for entry level DS. \n\n$82k house in Florida is likely a tear-down on a swamp and you\u2019ll have to build a new house. I think the median home sale price right now in the US is over $400k. In the HCOL cities with the high salaries (like San Francisco), median home price is over $1 million. \n\nAnother factor - college tuition. It ranges from $14k to $50k per year depending on if you go to a public or private university. The average monthly student loan payment is $400-500 and that\u2019s every month for anywhere from 10-30 years. \n\nNot sure how this compares to the UK, but outside of a few major cities (NYC and Chicago, etc), you have to own a car to get around. So that\u2019s another ~$20-30k maybe every 10 years for every driver in your household. \n\nAlso, childcare. I think the average cost of daycare is around $300/week for one kid. \n\nHealthcare has already been brought up. Yes, if you have a DS job, you likely have good health insurance. That\u2019s doesn\u2019t mean you\u2019ll never have to pay for healthcare. For example, it can be $1500 out of pocket to give birth, $3k if you need a c-section, although some online sources report it could be more.

(It\u2019s absolutely insane, maybe due to the job being remote) Even after filtering out those with quantitative degrees or relevant experience, we still had to deal with slightly over 100 candidates. Interview all of them is definitely out of the question here.\n\nThe process we had was to get them do a coding test. Easy to medium leetcode questions with some SQL questions. Of the 2/3 that passed, we send them an assignment with one week deadline. Once submitted, they get a zoom interview to present their work. Here\u2019s the thing, **take-home assignments work.** It very effectively cut down the number of applicants to around 10. \n\nI understand it\u2019s not fun doing these assignments, but given the job market, what\u2019s a good alternative that helps you filter among 100s of qualified candidates on paper, and also help you understand how they do their work and communicate? DS resumes these days all look the same. Everyone claims to know everything with no proof of proficiency. Recruiting is very time consuming and costly, and the cost of hiring a fraud DS costs even more.\n\nSome argue that assignments will deter the best candidates from continuing the application. The reality is that, unless it\u2019s meta or google, employers are not obsessed with finding the best person out of hundreds of candidates. They just want to find someone who is **good enough** to perform certain tasks without adding burden to the team. \n\nSo for those really hates take-home assignments, if you\u2019re in the position of hiring, how will you evaluate your applicants?",

If you\u2019re searching for a junior take home assignments are absolutely a good way to filter out the candidates. You can have thousands apply to a position and you wanna give everyone the same chance. The assignment is usually to filter out the most interested and determined ones in the position not the most desperate ones (being a junior on the market is on its own desperate enough). Sometimes people apply to a bulk of similar positions and do not thoroughly read the posting. Once you send the assignment candidates usually check if the position is really what they want and if yes they give it a try. The assignment should not require more that 3-4 hours of work at a rough estimate. \nThe higher the candidate level gets the less appropriate is a tha especially on the early stages of hiring process. I would never send a pre interview assignment to a middle and above level candidate. We can ask some examples of work or give out a small assignment that doesn\u2019t require hours of work after an interview but never before.",

Being able to demonstrate what I knew gave me a fighting chance over candidates who were presumed more qualified than me (yes, gender bias still exists and social sciences are often viewed as less \u2018rigorous\u2019). \n\nAs a hiring manager, short take home assignments have helped me hire better early career candidates for data analyst jobs. Their \u201cportfolios\u201d are often class work with small, simplified datasets. I want to see how they approach a real dataset, what their basic numeracy skills are like, whether they can code competently and cleanly, how well they can communicate their analysis, etc. \n\nAs a more senior job candidate now myself, I still don\u2019t mind take home tasks of a reasonable length. It\u2019s not insulting or beneath me. I enjoy the challenge, and it gives me a little glimpse into the kind of data and problems I might be working on. If I\u2019m short on time or can\u2019t meet the turn around deadlines, I just ask the hiring manager if I can present something from my personal portfolio instead. Most say yes."

The corollary of this is that you will have to apply to at least 100 places to get a chance. It's boring, takes a lot of you free time, but that's how it works. I talked to a woman who got hired at Microsoft as data scientist with a pretty similar CV as mine and she told me she applied six times to Microsoft before getting it. Keeping that in mind reduces the frustration of getting no response. You might be good but there are literally thousands of candidates for every position you apply, your chances are always low on the beginning.\n\n2- A referral is your best shot. Don't be shy to talk to everyone you know. Send email to professors and colleagues, check your acquaintances on LinkedIn to see if they could help you with a position. Sometimes this will make you be selected for a second phase.\n\n3 - Boost your LinkedIn. I was called by tech recruiters on LinkedIn a few times now. Didn't work at the end, but at least I was much closer than the other positions where I didn't even got a chance of being interviewed.

        "content": "I've started a new job in a industry company. \n\nBasically, my department does market analysis. They've been doing it for years and everything is a big Excel file. Everything is excel and kind of a mess. For more info about the context, here the [episode 1](https://old.reddit.com/r/dataengineering/comments/1271cb2/new_job_as_a_data_manager_the_data_is_a_bunch_of/) of my adventures.\n\nSo, I've had to build from scratch some kind of data *stack*. Currently it is :\n\n* A postgresql database\n* Jupyter environment\n\nTo be honest, I was skeptical about Jupyter because it shouldn't be a production jack-of-all-trades-data-tools. But so far so good.\n\nI'm fairly experienced in SQL, Python (for data analysis: pandas, numpy). \n\nHere is my question. A huge part of the job is producing charts and graphs and so on. **The most typical case is producing one chart and doing 10 variations of it**. Basically for each business line. So, it's just a matter a filtering there and there and that's it. \n\nBefore, everything was done in Excel. And kind of a pain, because you had a bunch of sheets and pivot tables and then the charts. You clicked update and everything went to shit because Excel freaks out if the context moves a tiny bit, etc. It was almost impossible to maintain consistency with colors, etc. So... not ideal. And on top of that, people had to draw by hand square and things on top of the charts because there are no ways to do it in Excel.\n\nMy solution for that is... Doing it in Python... And I don't know if it's a good idea. I'm self taught and has no idea if there are more proper way to produce charts for print/presentations. Main motivation was: \"I can get Python working fast, I really want to practice it more\"\n\nMy approach is:\n\n- If I have to produce a report, that is like 30 charts and they all have 5 variations. I build a notebook for this purpose. \n- In the notebook I try to make everything nice and tidy by using parameters and functions a lot (and comments, and text blocks with explanations for future-me). I try to pull data once (SQL) and keep it as a dataframe, manipulate it with Pandas and do the chart with Matplotlib. Each chart is a function and variations are handled by passing a parameters. And styling, etc. Is done by calling a module I've made.\n\nFor example, I want to produce the the bar chart `P3G2_B1`. It's the Graph #2 on page #3 for Business line #1. \n\nI call the function `P3G2()` with B1 as parameters and it produces the desired chart. With proper styling (Title, proper stylesheet, and a footer mentioning the chart id and the date). It's saved as a SVG (P3G2_B1.svg) and later converted to .EMF (because my company uses an old version of PPT that doesn't support SVG.\n\nSo far, what is good about this approach :\n\n- The charts look nice and are very visually consistent. Matplotlib allows me to specify a lot of things so there are few surprises.\n- It's fast enough. Doing an update and outputing 50 charts is a matter of minutes.\n\nWhat I'm not too happy about :\n\n- Matplotlib makes me miserable. I'm still learning Python and everything is painful. I find matplotlib confusing as hell. There are multiples and wildly different ways to do anything. Half of my days are just googling \"How to so <insert weird request> in matplotlib\". I've tried seaborn, plain pandas, and so on that are supposed to be *easier* than pure matplotlib. Well, I end up having to do something weird and having to sprinkle it with plain old matplotlib regardless. So I've decided to just go with it.\n- Matplotlib to do print is quite awful. My powerpoint slides have a grid, and let's say I want to create a bar chart that is 8 by 6 on this grid. So I expect a 800x600 pixels image. Not. so. easy. (especially since I need space for title and footer around the chart). What you see and not always what you get (through savefig, as an image file). My module handles that mostly OK but it's very hacky and still a mess. And also, the .svg to .emf conversion is another layer of pain. Some graphical things don't convert well (hatches for example).\n- Some charts functions are more than 100 hundreds lines of code. It scares me a bit. I have a hard time convincing people that it is better than Excel. They just see a house of cards waiting to fall.\n\nSo. Given the assignment, am I crazy to go with Python notebooks?\nDo you have suggestions to make my life easier producing nice, print quality charts to insert in Powerpoint?",

Then go into settings to break all links and Save As so your audience isn\u2019t prompted to update links when they launch the PowerPoint.\n\nI even have Excel generate text summaries of the data (eg, Last Week\u2019s Sales: +62 (+1.2%)) that I copy paste into PowerPoint\n\nI do this a few times a week and it saves me hours and prevents carpal tunnel syndrome \ud83d\ude4c\ud83c\udffc",

You should advocate, and that that will probably be painful, for that switch. Start with a POC with a free version and try convince people that they need that thing, accessible with a simple url, instead of those PowerPoints lol.",

ML is sometimes in this category, and sometimes not.\n\nWe also do engineering: formulating problems, defining resources and constraints, and designing/building solutions within that space.\n\nIMO the Science label is reasonable, but can't realistically be applied to every DS job description.",
            "Research and understanding vs building and creating. In practice (especially in industry you end up doing both quite a bit). I'd argue a decent analogy being that most software engineers studied computer science, ultimately it's not incredibly important but we do like to classify!",

            "Data Science is the application of the scientific method to how one works with and learns from data.\n\nThis can include things such as:\n\nDeveloping an understanding of the science of perception and cognitive psychology, and leveraging that understanding to improve how one visualizes and displays data in tables and charts and graphs.\n\nStudying the nature of one's data, in a particular field of study, and using the understanding of the reliability and fickleness of data to inform one on how to best analyze and interpret those data.\n\nConducting experiments across a range of algorithms and other factors such as methods of measurement, to determine the optimal methods and processes for making predictions and improving optimization.\n\nDoing the deep mathematical and computational work to develop new methods and processes that move the discipline forward.\n\n\nAbove all else, for me at least, data science means you are doing science.  It means you are applying the various tools associated with the scientific method.  I am a bit of a snob on this point, but I don't think you are doing data science if you don't have a deep understanding of the scientific method.  That doesn't require an advanced degree, but it does require experience in doing research, specifically research on quantitative and analytics methods and processes. \n\nScientists make objective observations, gather and organize information, and use the scientific method in order to obtain and organize and propagate knowledge.  Data scientists test hypotheses, for example \"what happens if I use a tree-based method of data reduction and then take those inputs and run them through an OLS regression?\".   \n\nFinally, scientists, and data scientists in particular, should not be afraid of heterodoxy.   Just because someone wrote a text that says such and such does not mean that is the truth in all cases.  This is a young discipline, and most statisticians and data scientists are not doing the research that colors outside the lines that were drawn by people who probably know less about the subject matter area that you are focused on than you do.\n\nRalph Waldo Emerson once wrote: \u201cA foolish consistency is the hobgoblin of little minds, adored by little statesmen and philosophers and divines.\"   Say what you think today, and if you think something different tomorrow, then say that."

Essentially, most of my time was spent in doing data entry, cleaning their excel sheets, updating their CRM with the cleaned data and creating some Power BI reports. I was recently browsing on LinkedIn and came across Data Analyst Job postings with descriptions that talked about skills in building data pipelines, bringing together data in a data warehouse, manipulating datasets in production environments, technologies and dbs such as Snowplow, MongoDB, PostgreSQL and Neo4j, and just felt so inadequate. Not only do I have no idea where to start, I am also losing knowledge of the ML, Statistics and coding skills I had in college. I do not have any senior at work who has done anything remotely in my field to seek advice from, and just answer to the Business Manager.\n\nAre there any books, websites, YouTube channels, or courses I could pursue in my weekends or free time to learn and develop these skills? I am very thankful I even have a job in this environment, but I fear being behind my peers and having no technical skills in the future at this rate. I don't even mind starting from the very beginning (How to be a Data Analyst/ Data Scientist? Learning Statistics from the basics, etc etc.) to polish my knowledge of this field. I just wanna be in a position where I can vouch for myself and my knowledge when leaving this company for a more competitive environment that actually matches DS. I am open to any and all advice and constructive criticism as well.",

All that other junk will come in due time with your success and the success of the business. Startups are by nature messy and disorganized. If you're not up for it by all means keep looking, but don't waste your time on self study if you're not applying what you're learning to something that matters to a hiring manager (e.g., business, open source projects, volunteering, etc).",
            "It sounds like the skills that are expected of you are those of a Data Engineer. If you learn about Data Engineering specifically, you will gain so many valuable skills for where you want to go down the line, opening you up to things like Machine Learning Engineering or MLOps. \n\nIt sucks that you can\u2019t use your Statistics and ML knowledge yet, but the #1 priority for data-immature orgs should be to set up data pipelines so that analyses can be done when enough data comes in. Data Engineering will teach you a lot about what you need to know for ML in a production environment, so try to look at this as a great opportunity! \n\nOn the other hand, if you absolutely know for sure that Data Engineering has 0 appeal to you, then you might not fit with your current company, and that\u2019s ok too",
            "Unfortunately, all entry-level jobs are like this. Assuming that you only have your bachelor\u2019s, what you are doing is likely the ceiling for these initial 1-2 years. \n\nNot sure how big the startup is, but at bigger companies they usually provide some structured trajectory. Something like: data analyst \u20142yr\u2014> data engineer \u20142yr\u2014> data scientist. Consider getting a MS if you plan on accelerating the process. \n\nRegardless, don\u2019t quit your job now. The market is too tough for you to job-hop now. Plus, it won\u2019t look good on your resume. At least wait for 1 year before making a move.",
            "The average job description of a Data Analyst, at least in the US, does NOT build data pipelines. The rest of the description\n> manipulating datasets in production environments, technologies and dbs such as Snowplow, MongoDB, PostgreSQL and Neo4\n\nReally could also just be \"writes PostgreSQL attached to MongoDB\". Don't let the fancy words in the JD make you dream of what you *could* be doing, just as the JD of your current role probably sounded a lot cooler than what you're actually doing now.\n\nIn reality, you don't need to be developing hard technical skills to avoid \"falling behind\". Fresh grads on average vastly underrate soft skills - understanding how the business/your industry works, how mid-level managers think/what kinds of questions they have, how to present, how to extrapolate, how to pressure test data, how to manage up, how to communicate in meetings, how to write emails, etc. etc. If you can learn these skills at work, and learn technical skills outside of work (kaggle, personal projects on a blog/website), you'll be totally fine. Put in your 2-3 years, network, and you'll be better off than 90% of your peers.",

Some thoughts:\n\n\\- **Most DS portfolios aren't very good.** So for most candidates they aren't very useful (e.g. generic Kaggle competitions, generic school projects, generic Twitter sentiment analysis projects). If you have 1 or 2 GOOD projects, then that's great! I had a friend land an DS job at Reddit back in 2017 because he spent 3 months building a fog prediction model for San Francisco (where he lived / where Reddit is HQ'd) based on a curiosity he had. He had a public map and website. THAT's a dope project that's hard, unique, and curiosity driven. A good replacement for a portfolio can be 1-2 strong research papers.\n\n\\- **What's the role?** If you see \"Data Scientist\", honestly I would dig way deeper. Is it actually a data analyst role, a data engineer role, an ML engineer role, an ML researcher role, or something else? If it's \"all of the above\", then you may be setup for failure and insane expectations. If it's an ML or Data Engineer role, then having live apps / websites that showcase something cool and impressive can be great. If it's an ML researcher role, only your papers matter. If you don't have any papers, its pretty much impossible to work on ML research.\n\n\\- **Can you showoff cutting edge skills?** If you learned a hot new framework or tool and built a project around that, that could be interesting. Airflow, Mage, Flyte, XetHub, etc. \n\nThat's how I think about it anyway!",

(You can laugh now). So the first wave we moved from excel dashboards to Tableau feeding out of OneDrive - which we could schedule with Prep Conductor.\nWhen we \u201cautomated\u201d all of those, then we started scripting on Python - I got my first analyst, as well.\nThen we moved some of the interactive things to R; automated data intake in AWS, and moved to SQL based queries directly on the vizzes.\nAll of that took *FIVE* years.\nIt was worth it because I liked doing it, it was challenging and I was forced to learn. I got a couple of promotions as well, and bonuses. \nBut you kind of get a mark on your back, anything goes slightly off the rails, and your name will be the first to pop up.

Having your data in CSVs is probably fine for now.\n\nOrchestrating tool may be next up. I personally wouldn't go for something as complicated as Airflow as a 1 man data engineer. Maybe check out Azure Data Factory if you're already a Microsoft shop. I've also seen it showing up more in discussions online. It should be a portable skill.\n\nAt that point, you might want to hire someone. Which means you should bug management beforehand, ideally. Get them up to speed.\n\nOnce they start taking over more things, update your resume with how you built the data engineering infrastructure for your company, made dashboards, connected your business analyst/other colleagues with the data infrastructure, and trained a teammate on how to develop and manage the infrastructure. If you can manage that, it will sound great (and be true). Then make your way over to another company where you can learn more from senior data scientists or engineers.",

Thus, for an aggregatator, the challenge is to operate their vpp fleet to maximize monetization for participation in day-ahead and real-time demand response markets e.g. optimizing the charge and discharge of batteries subject to system constraints and using forecasts on prices, capacity availability, etc.  Note that the markets differ in structure by region."

I\u2019m lucky enough to be graduating with no debt and am not really eager to voluntarily get it. The idea of taking 2 years off from making money is not very attractive as well. Also, part of me is just talking as a senior who\u2019s tired of school so there\u2019s that. \n\nBasically just looking for clarification on the topic from ppl already in industry and have navigated the market.",
        "comments": [
            "I was an Analyst and became a data scientist without a masters. But that was a different time, and I did get a masters pretty early in my career. I knew it was better to get it out of the way then, with my time becoming more precious and tuitions always rising. That\u2019s one way I look at it: the cheapest it\u2019s ever going to be is right now. \n\nGoing forward, I\u2019m sure many jobs will technically list a bachelors as the required education, but many of the other candidates will have masters, so effectively, a bachelors may not be enough to get out of the applicant pool.",
            "Just take a look at job postings. Almost every single one has Master's as a minimum with PhD preferred. A good path forward for you to keep the little to no student debt would be to find a DA role (make sure its one where you're actually writing code and doing technical work) at a company that will help pay for your graduate degree while you work. The experience plus the reduced cost graduate degree would be a nice way to get you closer to your goal without adding a ton of debt. If you're not willing to get the graduate degree, I genuinely don't think you're going to have a competitive enough resume even as an internal applicant.\n\nAlso, why do you think you can't do a Master's part time? The vast majority of people in CS related Master's programs are doing them part time while working full time.",
            "Quick few points for you to think about:\n\n* It's not quite true in the US that analyst is entry level and data scientist is senior. Are you non-US?\n* Regardless, if you want to work in the field you'll need a higher education degree to be competitive, there are simply way too many candidates and title is a first natural filter for recruiters.\n* If you have a job lined up already and are kind of burnt out from school, what's the real issue? Sounds like you're in a great position. Finish school, get some proper job experience and in 2 years think what you want to do. Consider a PhD in something mathematical. But masters are perfectly valid too.",
            "You don't need a MS, but most people's undergraduate programs do not prepare kids with everything they need to know to be ready for a data science role. \n\nSo for a lot of people it becomes a function of having gotten enough building blocks in undergrad to complement that with some self-learning and the right entry-level job to develop the rest - and it's sometimes easier/more efficient to just get a master's.\n\nAnd that just means that instead of spending 2 years in a MS program that gets you in the door for a DS role, it may take you 4-5 years in a DA role, maybe a job change or 2, and some personal time spent honing your skills to get into that first role where you are now building towards a DS career.\n\nI also think some majors are better suited for that career path - namely the ones that are more focused on the math/stats side of things. Coding is easier to learn on your own/on the job (or at least people are much less judgemental of people who learned to code that way).\n\nNow, the other thing that happens to people that go the DA route - you may just never want to switch to DS. You may find yourself 4 years in getting promoted to being an Analytics Manager, and all of the sudden you could be looking at taking a paycut and demotion to go be a data scientist. Is it worth it? Maybe. Maybe not. Depends on what you value.\n\nMy personal advice: don't assume you need an MS until you're in a job search and you find yourself unable to get the job you want because you don't have a MS. And do not assume that  you know what job you're going to want in 4 years - work first. You'll learn a lot about yourself.",
            "If you want to do data science then best plan on an MS. It used to be possible to do DS with a BS and a lot of good experience and skills but these days employers are very elitist and rigid about the educational requirements."

Their idea is to bring in intermediaries to do the translation of business needs. Some of the teams who've been in the org for a long time see this as only an image building exercise of creating a new verticle. To shut the naysayers' mouths they've hired DS consultants to do the talking on a technical front.

This might sound like a luxury problem to have, but once you are beyond your 40s and have a family, it's not so much fun to be put in front of an undisclosed choice to either not progress anymore significantly or be forced to become a manager and give up that which you are really good at. Obviously, one could argue that many data scientists, to progress further, need to learn how to be more outgoing, extrovert, present themselves etc. - but that's not what I'm referring to. I've seen brilliant people leave the company because there was just not a lot more possible for the positions they were in.\n\nSo, does there exist a glass ceiling for specialist roles such as data scientists?\n\nWhat are your observations?",

            "Big tech companies will have an IC (individual contributor) track that has many levels, at my last company, they had 6 levels for data scientists. This is similar to software engineers. Very few make it to the top level (usually \u201cPrincipal\u201d or \u201cLead\u201d or something like that), they typically have 15+ YOE and also often a PhD as well. They usually work on very high-level projects directly with leadership, and often lead projects that other data scientists contribute to. Usually they also mentor others. But they don\u2019t manage any direct reports. Their salaries are often on par with department managers/directors and sometimes VPs.",
            "In general, you\u2019re always going to have to manage *something*. By that I mean you\u2019re going to have to either manage people or projects. Managing a project means being the senior IC on an effort with multiple ICs (potentially on different teams). It means being more focused on the design of the project and ensuring that deliverables are mapping to business outcomes than it does doing hands on data work. \n\nAt the end of the day, you can only advance so much doing hands on data work, since you\u2019re just one person, and your seniority generally will map 1:1 with your impact at the company. That\u2019s not to say that you will never do technical work as a senior+ IC (especially if you have a very specific area of expertise that is business critical and not shared by the rest of the company). However at some point, to really reach that next level in impact, seniority, and salary, it\u2019s not enough to be good at what you do. You have to be able to make others better at what they do.",
            "This is a problem for all technical roles. Many companies profess to have a 'technical' track but progress is usually slower and doesn't reach as high.\n\nI thought that was widely known...",
            "I work a Deloitte and I am equivalent of Senior Manager in the Product Delivery track. I have around 15 years of experience and just 36 years of age. I have experience in Software Engineering, Network Engineering and Systems Admin, and Data Science (Applied Statistics when I was in college). I studied Math and Physics in undergrad and Math/Stats and EE in grad school.\n\nI have both a team/technical lead and IC a work that I am responsible for along with I help to expand business through being a technical advisor and final reviewer after pins down.\n\nIn my responsibilities, as a technical lead for my projects, I typically architect the solution, build the basic core application to be extended by my team and my future self, create CI/CD pipeline, testing harnesses for points of integration and a mix of tasks from such as Project Management/Planning, Code Reviews, etc. I also create a lot of utility scripts for ingest pipes for test data, user authentication, etc. \n\nIn my company, there is only one more level for me to climb to which is the PPMD - Principal, Partner and Manager Director level, there is a technical role called Tech Fellow which I am on deck for next promotion cycle. It should be noted that this role has only existed for two years and I was at the bar when the promotion was announced for the first tech fellow at Deloitte. \n\nIn general, as a technical person I\u2019ve found that the biggest way for me to advance is by getting really good at a core offering that you want to do. I think with Data Scientists, the ceiling is lower than for someone who can build an entire system or a system of systems. The reason, I say that in production data science components are created which is just one mechanism of a larger system, you still have to contend with things like load balancing, availability, deployment processes, etc. \n\nBecause Data Science regardless of the hype is not a new field, it\u2019s was just a rebranding of Applied Statistics, Data mining, etc. these are obviously important aspects of understanding a set of data or your user base, but they themselves do not have a core value proposition, outside of Business Intelligence, unless they are integrated directly into a product or service.\n\nWhen I worked in the Casino Industry, I was tucked away in the Market department. I was creating reports using SQL and automating various components of that with Python, etc. my official job title was Database Analyst/Statistician, I made 32,500 dollars starting. I wanted to get the DBM title after a year and a half of proving my worth to the company which would have brought me to 55k in Missouri. I was not given the opportunity to promote because I was told that I would need to manage people for that.\n\nWe separated ways shortly after that. One of the failures that I had was in negotiations, I didn\u2019t sell the value proposition well that I was already doing IT related work since 2005. For some reason, I knew that experience was valuable but didn\u2019t see how necessary it would be at the time in my career. \n\nI mentioned that because I have found that the biggest gains I have made in terms of salary is by finding a new job, same with responsibility. The down side to this is that you have this switching cost for your career that is not discussed very much which is akin to like a context switch. This cost is necessary to pay and can be painful, it\u2019s that when you take on a new position at a new company, you have to prove yourself all over again, they like you cause they hired you, but now can you deliver? This is the big cost to pay, because it may mean you need to work longer hours, etc. \n\nAt the end of the day, I think the ceiling is lower for a data scientist than someone who has a wider range of technical skills. This is obviously my option from what I have seen in my career, I don\u2019t even like to position myself as a data scientist typically because the offers I get are much less than the roles that I typically do work now. \n\nI would highly recommend reading the book Developer Hegemony by Erik Dietrich. It breaks out the cold hard truth that we as technical people largely play subordinate roles with the corporate structure. It can be pretty gloomy reading the book at times, it does however offer a silver lining to escape the corporate rat race. And the solution it proposes is smaller teams or consultancy firms, where these small teams take on more risk by not being at a big firm but there is less corporate structure to siphon the profits. I would also recommend the book The Company of One by Paul Jarvis and many others. \n\nI think there is a sweet spot between being a small company and making a great salary. It will no doubt be a lot of work, but that\u2019s something I am pursuing now on the side. I plan to sell courses, trainings, and SaaS products, I want to build revenue that require an initial time investment and become more profitable with time. \n\nI hope that helps.",

I would recommend first automating a process to get all of the raw data into the warehouse. Then build further automation to clean it up inside of the warehouse as you need clean data. Sometimes this is called ELT. \n\nEventually you'll have a lot of stuff in clean form and it will be \"easy\" for people to explore and interact with the cleaned data, but you'll always have everything available in its original messy form if you need to answer one-off questions or explore.\n\nIf software devs need to deliver data to you periodically, have them dump the data in a GCS bucket. Best case, they use parquet format because it's strongly typed and well structured. Second choice would be \\`.jsonl\\`, last choice \\`csv\\` or other text formats. Bonus points if they can deliver the data in sharded form. \n\nLikewise, you may eventually be dumping out data in the same way for others to consume..eventually. \n\nWhen you want to do stuff locally on a workstation, prep the data in BigQuery, dump it out to a GCS bucket in parquet format, download that, and suck it into your python/whatever code, then put the results back into BigQuery. \n\nAvoid pandas. use SQL as much as possible. Keep analysis in BigQuery as much as possible. Virtually anything you do in BigQuery will scale gracefully over time.\n\nA good web-based dashboarding tool will allow you to easily surface results to others, enable them to explore, and enable you to demo or explore data live with other people in a way that is a lot more elegant than a Jupyter notebook. \n\nThis is a kind of minimal setup, but you can do everything from product analytics to machine learning or recommendation systems on this basic fabric, it's all pretty easy to spin up, and it's a very productive environment.",

            "One important purpose of the confusion matrix is making the quality of the model visible when the classes are imbalanced. If you have a binary classification problem where 99% of your data points are negative, your model can achieve a 99% accuracy by always predicting \"negative\". Looking at the confusion matrix shows the strength of your model better.\nAnother case where the confusion matrix helps is when you want to weigh predictions by your model differently. E.g. if you are manufacturing parts and use your model to predict whether a part is faulty and needs to go for re-testing, you may want to send the part for re-testing when the model predicts a fault with a certain probability under 50% because you absolutely want to avoid faulty parts. What you can do to figure out this probability for the decision is to change the threshold and see how the confusion matrix changes until you have no more false negatives. I wrote this from my phone and might not have explained things super clearly. Let me know if you have questions!",
            "A confusion matrix is a table used to evaluate the performance of a classification model in machine learning. It shows the number of true positives, false positives, true negatives, and false negatives for each class in the dataset. The purpose of a confusion matrix is to help visualize how well the model is performing in terms of correctly predicting each class.In a confusion matrix, the rows represent the actual classes, and the columns represent the predicted classes. The four possible outcomes are:True Positive (TP): The model correctly predicts a positive class.False Positive (FP): The model predicts a positive class, but the actual class is negative.True Negative (TN): The model correctly predicts a negative class.False Negative (FN): The model predicts a negative class, but the actual class is positive.From a confusion matrix, several metrics can be calculated to evaluate the performance of the model. The most commonly used metrics are precision, recall, and F1 score.Precision measures the proportion of correctly predicted positive instances out of all positive predictions. It is calculated as TP/(TP+FP). Precision is a useful metric when the cost of false positives is high. (I recently came over this in ML class.) CUrrently studying at [Consoleflare.com](https://Consoleflare.com)",
            "All of the metrics tell you something different and you should think carefully (don't go read about it, literally think through it yourself) what conclusions you can draw from the various metrics and in what situations they're important.  If you want to start with an easy one, read the definition of precision and think about the implications of precision in a scenario where false positives are costly.

Hell, you don't even know how many fishermen fished the lake this year.\n\nIs the goal of the analysis (a) to estimate the distribution of the numbers of fish that would be caught by fishermen over a 12 month period? Or is it to estimate (b) the distribution of the numbers of fish that would be caught by **successful** fishermen over a 12 month period? Who knows!

Apparently the 'correct' answer is that you \"deal with the nonzero probability at 0\" by deciding to discard question (a) on the fly in favor of (b), and then correctly guessing that an appropriate distribution to deal with question (b) could be a truncated Poisson.\n\nThese 'gotcha' type questions are stupid, not only because they are 'gotchas' but because of the antiscientific way of thinking they promote. Fuck it, the data are limited, so let's just answer a different question!

If you didn't happen to know about the truncated Poisson distribution, who gives a shit? I can teach you that. What is far more difficult to teach (and is the appropriate thing to test in an interview) is being able to perceive that the data collection procedure presents us with a measurement problem and restricts the universe of things that we can estimate with it.\n\nSucks that you 'failed' this question, but you can take comfort in the fact that so did the interviewer."

            "just for fun I asked Mistral 7B this exact question feeding it with your post :\n\n> Sure! I'd be happy to help clarify the relationship between language models like GPT and tasks such as  \ntext editing, code debugging, or sentiment analysis.  \nFirst, let me start by explaining that while large language models can generate human-like text based   \non given context, they don't truly \"understand\" the meaning of the text in the same way humans do.   \nInstead, they make predictions based on patterns and statistical relationships learned during training.  \nWhen it comes to tasks like text editing or code debugging, the model is not directly predicting the   \nnext word, but rather generating a response that fulfills the given request. This requires some   \nadditional capabilities beyond next-word prediction.  \nOne common approach for enabling models to perform these tasks is through \\*\\*prompt engineering\\*\\* and   \n\\*\\*fine-tuning\\*\\*. In this context, a prompt is the instruction or input provided to the model. By   \ncarefully designing the prompt, we can guide the model to focus on specific aspects of its knowledge or  \nabilities. For example, to perform text editing, we might provide a prompt like \"Fix the spelling   \nerrors in this essay,\" which encourages the model to make corrections based on context and grammar   \nrules.  \nFine-tuning refers to the process of training a pre-existing language model on a new, domain-specific   \ndataset to adapt its knowledge and improve performance on that particular task. For instance, we might   \nfine-tune a large language model on a collection of bug reports or code snippets for debugging,   \nproviding it with additional context and examples specific to this domain.  \nSimilarly, for sentiment analysis, which involves determining the emotional tone of a given text, we   \nmight provide prompts like \"What emotion is conveyed in this comment?\" or \"Determine the attitude   \ntowards this product mentioned in the text.\" The model would be fine-tuned on a large dataset of   \nlabeled text examples to help it learn and recognize the patterns associated with different emotional   \ntones.  \nSo, while a language model may not inherently \"understand\" the meaning of text or code like humans do,   \nwe can effectively use prompts and fine-tuning techniques to guide the model towards performing   \nspecific tasks, such as text editing, debugging, or sentiment analysis."

I recently had a negative experience with Capital One for a data science position. Details are below:\n\n* I was reached out by a recruiter from C1 about 2 weeks ago, asking for my availability for a 30 mins interview. I responded within that day my availability for that week and the week after.\n* Recruiter responded 5 days later, agreeing to schedule a call at 3PM the day after\n* The day after, recruiter sent me an email right before the call, saying that he needed to push back the call to the next day. I agreed and provided him with my availability for that day. Recruiter did not send any confirmation response.\n* The day after that, recruiter emailed me at 2:40PM, asking me if he could call at 3PM. I was in a meeting at the time, but still agreed to take the call and left the meeting early.\n* Recruiter never called at 3PM. He sent an email at 4:30PM stating that \u201csomething came up that was very time-sensitive,\u201d without any apology, and offered to reschedule for 6 PM that day or the next day. Again, I replied with an agreement to take the call at 6PM\n* Recruiter never called at 6PM.\n* The next day, I sent another email to recruiter, but this time, I copied Capital One's main careers/HR email address. He called me within a minute after I sent the email (lol).\n* The call lasted for 5 mins, for what was supposed to be a 30 mins call. He asked me basic questions like salary expectations, and relocation. I was not even asked \"Do you have any other questions about this role?\"\n* Recruiter said he would forward my resume to 2 hiring managers, and would let me know what they think. I asked for the hiring manager's names, and he said he would send me their linkedin profiles in a follow-up email.\n* Of course, I never received this follow-up email. I sent him an email asking for the hiring managers' contact info. He never replied.\n* Early morning the next day, I received a rejection email. Mind you, our call was around 5PM the previous day. This made me wonder whether my resume was ever forwarded to the hiring managers at all.\n\nTL,DR: Was flaked on 3 times by C1's recruiter. Finally got a super brief call because I copied the main HR email address in the chain. Got rejected the next day.\n\nWhat do you think I should have done differently in this process? Also, I was thinking about sending a feedback for this process to the main HR address, but not sure if this would be the right move?",

We then calculate relative change % between the staging and target table (for each field), and if the change is higher than some threshold, validation fails. But there's obviously a lot of issues with this (like in cases where a change from 1 to 18 is normal but produces a percent change of 1700).\n\nThis is just an example, but it would be helpful if we can call an API to do this sort of validation for us.\n\nAnd instead of using absolute change, relative change, etc... is there perhaps a tool that can validate based on historical changes?

The signal to noise ratio is very low and you will end up misled if you don't already know better.\n\nI really like the weekly [Data Elixir](https://dataelixir.com/) newsletter, which does a nice job of curating quality posts across a variety of topics. \"Good\" data science posts I see elsewhere on social media tend to end up linked there, including rarer quality Medium/TDS content.\n\nI've also been reading [Andrew Gelman's blog](https://statmodeling.stat.columbia.edu/) for over a decade and a half. While it can be esoteric, it's definitely made me a much sharper thinker about the nature of measurement and scientific practices that I bring to my day-to-day work. I think these topics do not get their due in broader writing on \"data science\" which tends to focus much more heavily on engineering than science IMO, so he's bringing something distinctive to the table not seen on Medium/TDS. If you work with survey data or study design at all, his blog is a must read.\n\nedit: one more to add -- I really like Randy Au's Substack newsletter [Counting Stuff](https://counting.substack.com/) which also skews more conceptual/philosophical about the nature of data collection and thinking about measurement.",

This would help you pick up more fundamental data science and also being able to read papers is par for the course. Literature reviews are a good place to start because they cover large swaths of topics and are approachable."

This interaction parameters encode for the change of the original parameter from the old to the new data.  You can use regular regularization to shrink this.  \n\nHere's the sequence:\n\n- Original: Y=c+BX\n- Add dummy: Y=c+B1\\*X+B2\\*D+B3\\*X\\*D\n- for original data (D=0): Y=c+B1\\*X+B2\\*0+B3\\*X\\*0 =Y=c+BX\n- for new data (D=1): Y=c+B1\\*X+B2\\*1+B3\\*X\\*1 =Y=(c+B2)+(B1+B3)X -> B3 encodes for the changed relation in your new data.",

            "You could do the Bayesian way but since that might be slow, this actually isn't too bad to just code up in Pytorch with a custom loss function.\n\nBayesian could also be sped up by using the MAP (maximum a posteriori) estimate (via variational inference using a delta function as the variational distribution) rather than a full Bayesian approach. That will be able to work on large datasets just fine. Then essentially if you use Normal priors, this can be shown to be equivalent to an L2 regularization with the custom loss for deviating from the assumed coefs. While Laplace priors will be equivalent to L1 regularization. (You will not get uncertainty however using the MAP approach).\n\nActually this is probably easiest and I believe it is possible to be done in brms out of the box. Or rstan/cmdstanr (if it can't be done in brms directly which I think it can be, you can use brms which has easier syntax if you don't know stan to get the stan code automatically and then do this via rstan/cmdstanr--since the optimization is separate from the Stan code itself).\n\nIf you prefer Python then Pyro can also do it [https://pyro.ai/examples/mle\\_map.html](https://pyro.ai/examples/mle_map.html). But I find Pyro a bit harder than Stan due to lack of examples. (rstan/cmdstanr also has an MLE option here https://mc-stan.org/docs/cmdstan-guide/maximum-likelihood-estimation.html which if you have priors is basically MAP so I think VI with a delta explicitly may not be needed, but it is the way to do it in Pyro)"

It was a data set I actually received as a technical interview of synthetic salary data and made a salary predictor based on 6 factors. Super uninspiring use case and data set. How did that help me get interviews? I'll try to provide some details and my process...\n\nDo you need the fanciest model, data set, or methods to make an impressive portfolio project? Absolutely not.\n\nMost portfolio projects hiring managers likely come across are similar to Kaggle competition notebooks. Load in a data set, run some preliminary EDA -> [model.fit](https://model.fit)(). What you need to do is spend time trying to stand out from the rest of the crowd.\n\nDo this by:\n\n* Giving your project a catchy and interesting title on your resume. I did not call my project \"Salary prediction model\". Not recommending stocks predictions per se. But for example, come up with something that is fun and intriguing e.g. \"Can I predict the future of Tesla stock? Maybe I can!\"\n* Focus on the structure of your git repo. Make it clean and easy to understand by organizing folders into EDA notebooks, modeling notebooks, and a source code folder for convenience functions. You want to abstract your code into functions that you call over and over - this shows you can write maintainable code.\n   * Add a project overview to your main README that details what problem you are solving and why it matters, at a high level that business stakeholders can understand.\n   * Include details and images in your README for your EDA and modeling process along with the results and conclusions.\n   * Include a 'Next steps section' to list some ideas on how your project can improve your your model\n* Create some kind of end-to-end solution\n   * Put your code into a docker container and host it on some free or cheap hosting provider. I used Heroku when the free tiers were still around.\n   * I spent 2 weeks after my model was done learning some basic JavaScript and stack overflowed my way through creating a simple React UI that could interact with my model and make predictions on new data. Others have mentioned streamlit which is also a very good approach. I wanted to learn more about API creation so I built the back-end API and UI myself in React.\n\nActually the majority of the time I spent on my portfolio project was documentation, writing clean code including doc strings and python type hints, and deploying my model to Heroku. I spent maybe 10% of time developing and testing models.",

But I just can't convince myself to take the time to learn it without better understanding the use case.\n\nI'm a Data Scientist at a Saas company, and we have a fairly mature data science / ml team and Terabytes of data to play with. That being said, none of us have ever touched or even thought of touching Hadoop. It's not that we don't have lots of data -- but I'm just not seeing the use case. Most stuff you can just batch if the data is too large. Or spin up an AWS instance that's a little bigger. Compute just seems to be growing sufficiently fast that I'm not really into the Hadoop hype. Even things like, say a linear model where you really can't do the matrix inversion in batches you can just take a random sample of 100k data points and basically converge to the model.",

            "No.\n\nYou described exactly  why people don't use Hadoop anymore. You can now independently scale compute (spin up a bigger AWS instance) and storage in the cloud. Back in hadoop's days this wasn't necessarily the case and things were done on-prem. It's a product of its time where compute and storage were tightly coupled.\n\n>Even things like, say a linear model where you really can't do the matrix inversion in batches you can just take a random sample of 100k data points and basically converge to the model.\n\nYou'd never do a matrix inversion in this case, you'd run it with stochastic gradient descent. They converge to the same result and one is more memory efficient anyway.",
            "My company uses Hadoop. It was the popular big data solution before the cloud became popular. We still use it because it\u2019s way cheaper. Cloud is about 3-4x as expensive. The downside is you need an infrastructure person to build and maintain it. The cloud handles all that for you. It\u2019s popularity has declined and will continue to decline unless the cloud bubble bursts due to tight budgets.",
            "For starters most of these lists are just repurposed stuff from years and content producers that may not reflect the current market and specially wherever you are situated. \n\nHadoop is an ecosystem not just a tool, so the learning curve is quite step and administrating it is proportionally harder. When people say Hadoop most of the time they mean a combination of HDFS, Hive and/or MapReduce which were a couple of years ago by far the best solutions for massive parallel processing of big data, but it's important to know that most Hadoop distributions have over 20 different tools for all kinds of purposes, from ODS to DWs, from Streaming to Batch ETL.\n\nI would rather recommend you learning Spark and a DW like Snowflake since they are the current industry standards and they can be used instead of or complementing Hadoop solutions in most new-ish projects.",
            "Not an expert, so take this with a grain of salt, but my impression is it's not as relevant with the public cloud.",
            "I don\u2019t agree that Hadoop is dead. Instead SELF-MANAGED Hadoop is dead. As others have said, Hadoop is a platform not a single tool. It provides a few tools that are still widely used like YARN, HDFS, and some of the more low-level protocols for working with a distributed system. However, you don\u2019t really see that much nowadays because it\u2019s become so cheap to use a vendor-managed platform like EMR or HD Insight. It\u2019s probably not AS important these days to learn how to manage a Hadoop environment yourself, ESPECIALLY as a data scientist. Leave that to the data engineers."

Bring an organization from zero to data maturity from what is essentially a blank slate.\n\nReality, if they\u2019re still schlepping flat files in 2024 and have not once hired a DBA in the last 25 years to build them some semblance of a database to collect and store historic records in one place\u2026 I mean, actions are louder than words. They might be saying they are/want to be data driven, but they will never support your work the way it needs to be supported. It\u2019s a huge undertaking, will take years to get them up to speed, maybe decades. All the while the company will fall further behind the competitive curve as data innovations will remain out of reach for their lack of foundational data management, use, and governance processes and tooling\u2026 and stores.\u00a0\n\nDay one you\u2019ll be fighting for budget to build out a lake and warehouse and any transactional layers for all the excel file processing they\u2019re doing, for hosting and licenses and vendor due diligence for said database(s). Then you need pipeline systems and automation/scheduling/orchestration, same deal. All the while the boomer execs will be clamoring for AI right fucking now because, \u201carent we data driven yet since you\u2019ve been spending so much on the base data houseboats? Where\u2019s mah Ay Eye?!?!\u201d\n\nThen o marketing will see the attention and budget you\u2019re getting and start spinning shadow analytics with some fly by night vendor that bought them a steak dinner. They\u2019ll turn around a dashboard in a week and exclaim from the top of the nearest mountain how successful their data initiatives were and how they should be allowed some of your budget for expanding their stuff, further preventing you from doing it the correct way.\u00a0\n\nThen you\u2019ll start getting pressure from above about why they haven\u2019t seen results yet. Why it\u2019s taking so long. Why they can\u2019t brag about it in the golf course or when they do, their buddies chuckle and say they did that 15 years ago and already hired an MBA to lay everyone off who built it and saved a million bucks outsourcing it now.\u00a0\n\nAnd still, you won\u2019t be doing stats. You\u2019ll be doing data engineering, network admin, DBA, and vendor management, politics, and begging for budget and headcount.\u00a0\n\nThen, when you\u2019ve got something to show for the effort, the sales director will come bearing down your door about why your reports don\u2019t match their reports they\u2019ve been using for years - come to find out they\u2019ve been manually tracking their sales without independent oversight in excel and manipulating their numbers under the guise of \u201cnot a math person\u201d to make them look better. Complicate that by the transaction layer privileges being too loose and allowing the sales teams to manually go in and change around who gets credit for which sale right before they review quotas each month, literally cooking the books. That won\u2019t line up with your clean and independently audited warehouse data and they certainly won\u2019t be losing their jobs since they are a profit center, unlike you an expensive cost center.\n\nAdd to all that daily arguments with IT about who does what with regards to setting this stuff up and manages it. Who pays for it. Why they won\u2019t support a new tool you need because it runs on Linux and they\u2019re a windows shop. Why they won\u2019t learn Linux or the new tool or anything that came out in the last 15 years.\u00a0\n\nThen you\u2019ll start applying to new jobs fed up with being paid as a data analyst but doing the work of like 20 separate roles and find your breadth of experience is wide but generally inapplicable to anything besides working for companies still trying to do data from flat files in the year 2030. Your depth of experience not enough to actually get any call backs from recruiters.\u00a0",

The employer probably just needs a data engineer to start building databases, but they don't know the difference. Not to mention, an employer like that won't have a platform for you to deploy ML and won't provide mentors. You'd be on your own in a hole!\n\nThis mess is not a good experience for you; there are questions in every legit, high paying, data science interview about the size of data you worked with, sql, types of databases, etc. Just mention excel and you are out!.\n\nIf you are seriously considering taking that job, then you need to think about changing your career goals. Perhaps get into management or business analyst type of role. Those are the type of experiences you'd be gaining, not data science."

            "I feel like I have a fairly good understanding of this issue. I'm a MD/PhD finishing my specialty training and doing the MIDS masters at UC Berkeley. I've also worked on ML research projects looking to improve prediction of management outcomes in my domain.\n\nWhen I was going through medical school ten years ago, I had the same questions just as ML was beginning to take off. This is a very nuanced question that isn't as black and white as most people understand it to be. I'll give my top reasons for why\n\n1. The medical field  as a whole is resistant to change - This is due to both internal and external factors. Internally, doctors like any profession do not want to be replaced but also don't want to adopt technology that isn't proven with the **highest** level of evidence (i.e. Phase 3 RCTs).  Externally, depending on your country, there are barriers for using technology without approval (FDA approval) and the question of 'who pays for it?'\n2. Doctors are the gatekeepers - Follow on from point 1. No one wants to be replaced. In medicine, doctors are the gatekeepers and so they're in a unique position to push back compared to many other professions. Doctors control EVERYTHING in their profession - particularly outside the US where most systems are predominantly public. I think the turning point will be phase 3 RCTs which show superiority and also widespread adoption in countries where resources are taxed and they have no choice (NHS in the UK for example).\n3. Poor data  - There's lots of diagnoses that are fairly rare and for which there is not great data to run classification algo's on to get a good answer. These small data problems are a challenge across the board not only for clinicians but for data scientists. If we had a global connected data collection system for all hospitals that was centralised, this would be much much easier. We don't, so this limits what we can classify to an extent. Even when we do have the data, the question is - is it good quality data? will that data become less relevant with time (e.g. MRI technology evolves)?  is it externally valid (e.g. classification on white patients, is this applicable to an Asian population?) While i'm sure AI systems can diagnose a lot of things, it also can't diagnose a lot of other things well because of limitations of bad data at present.\n4. Lack of all round sensor data - Diagnosis isn't just feed in history and lab tests. There's also the patient affect, the collateral history, their gait when they walk into the ER - amongst a ton of other data. All these things aren't being captured by sensors at present and until they are, your algos will run with less information than a doctor. This matters a LOT. it's not just breadth of data it's also depth. There was a prostate cancer prediction algo years ago trained on 10,000 patients that had only an accuracy of about 70%. We can get to 90-95% now with 300 patients with better data. That's not even the best data we could get, but it certainly gives pause to the idea that we need more and better data.\n5. **Does it change management?** This is one of the **KEY concepts** that I think non-doctors and even more junior doctors don't understand. If I could encapsulate medical decision making into one phrase it would be does it change your management. If it doesn't, who cares. If your diagnostic algo increased your diagnosis rate of pneumonia from 85% to 95% would it change what I do in clinic? Most of the time the answer is no, I would still prescribe antibiotics. So now i've invested $100 million in some algo that doesn't change what I do, so what?  AI will be held to a higher standard than a human (because if a human fails you can throw them under the bus). This will necessitate performance that is almost perfect\n6. Lack of explainability - This is also on the surface a big one. Although surprisingly patients care less about this (in the research literature) than doctors by a big margin. One study i recently read of patients in breast cancer said most didn't think AI explainability was important. For clinicians however, who back to point 2, control the system it is important. We are getting there now with things like attention neural networks helping provide some level of explainability even using more 'black boxy' methods.\n7. Finally - on a side note - diagnosis in my opinion is not where ML/AI will make the most gains in medicine. I don't think an AI diagnosis will improve diagnostic yield most of the time and I don't think it will change management most of the time. Therefore, the yield of diagnostic AI seems low relative to the cost. Whilst I think it is a priority area, I think too much research and money is being spent on diagnostics. I really think the biggest gains will be made in therapeutic management especially in cancer care where drugs can cost in excess of 100k/yr.\n\nHappy for DMs. Really excited about what ML/AI can do for medicine and want to help accelerate this for patients.",
            "They exist, doctors just don\u2019t want to use it. To be fair, patient safety is also not something you want to just trust to a black box system. People may prefer the known evil (doctors missing things, having their own biases, etc) to the unknown one (chatgpt hallucinations).",
            "Some hospitals have medical search systems similar to Google. You put in your symptoms, lab results whatnot and it spits out options for you including treatment recommendations. It basically relies on peer reviewed meta-analysis for every diagnosis/treatment option and represents the current best course of action.\n\nSimilarly when you have a diagnosis and are prescribing something the system will check if it matches the overall state of the patient (males won't be pregnant or have birth complications, females won't have erectile dysfunction etc.) and spit out warnings or whether there are drug incompatibilities, dosages outside of recommended values for that patient etc.\n\nBasically most of the work is automated and for juniors/students it's basically \"do what the computer tells you to do or you'll get in trouble\".\n\nThis stuff has been around since like the 90's and the most modern versions will data mine your notes and make suggestions like auto-fill instead of requiring you to make a query.\n\nSuch systems have been superhuman for decades. It's less likely to make an error than a human because it never strays off the freshest peer-reviewed research.\n\nWhenever such systems are implemented the doctors love them because it catches all of their mistakes (which there are a lot of working those 24h shifts) and makes their job a lot easier. \n\nThey don't use it to diagnose because they already know the answer. They just use it to make sure they didn't miss anything and as a link to get the treatment recommendations.\n\n\nThis is expensive as fuck, has to be tailored for local regulations, integrated with existing systems etc. so not many hospitals go through the trouble. We're talking half a billion dollar project for **one** hospital. Mostly because every god damn hospital has completely custom and non-standard software written in some ancient programming language.\n\nMost of these systems are deployed outside the US where for example the entire country uses the same system and has the same regulations so spending a few hundred millions is fine.\n\nsource: worked on such systems in 2000's.",
            "Because doctors cry",
            "I work in health care, and there's a variety of reasons why we tend to lag a decade or so behind most other industries. Liability concerns, doctor/hospital/insurer incentives usually aren't aligned, privacy regulations make it difficult to amass large enough datasets to train on, shit's still written in MUMPS, Judy Faulkner is a curmudgeon, etc. etc.\n\nNone of these obstacles are impossible to overcome, but overcoming each of them takes time/money and provides an additional opportunity for failure."

Price of old product, Total Points of Sale of Old Product where new product has been introduced to adjust for more/less distribution, and finally, unit sales of new product. \n\nSo everything is aggregated at a weekly level, and at a product level. I\u2019m not sure if I need to create dummy variables for the week of the year.\n\nThe points of sale are also aggregated to show total points of sale per week instead of having the sales per store per week. Should I create dummy variables for this as well?\n\nI\u2019m analyzing only the stores where the new product has been introduced. Is this wrong?\n\nI\u2019m normalizing all of the independent variables, is this wrong? Should I normalize everything? Or nothing?\n\nMy R^2 is about 15-30% which is what\u2019s freaking me out.  I\u2019m about to just admit defeat because the statistical \u201ctests\u201d chatgpt recommended all indicate linear regression just aint it bud. \n\nThe coefficients make sense (more price less sales), more points of sale more sales, more sale of new product less sale of old.\n\nMy understanding is that the tests are measuring how well it\u2019s forecasting sales, but for my case I simply need to analyze the historical relationship between the variables. Is this the right way of looking at it? \n\nEdit: Just ran mode with no normalization and got an R2 of 51%. I think Chat Gpt started smoking something along the process that just ruined the entire code. Product doesn\u2019t seem to be cannibalizing, seems just extremely price sensitive.",

            "Also not my industry, but I think you should take a step back and consider the specific quantities that need to be isolated to get at this question before even thinking about regression. In particular, my first pass guess is that you need to capture both whether absolute sales of new product A are increasing while old product B is decreasing over time, but this might not be correct. Make plots, tables, descriptive stats. A useful comparison here would also be to compare stores where the product was rolled out against stores where the product was not rolled out, to see whether old product B sales decrease in stores with the new product compared to those without. IMO you could almost answer this question entirely descriptively, and then build a model later down the line once you\u2019ve got a good handle on the fundamental patterns.",
            "You want to model the effect that sales of Product A (Asales) has on the sales of product B (Bsales). \n\nYou could use a simple linear regression, such that: \n\nBsales = Asales + other factors + error term. \n\nA model of this make will be able to give you an idea of the association between your products sales numbers.\n\nIf you happen to have data on a granular enough level, and know the date the product was introduced,  you could specify the following model for a more casual estimate:\n\nBsales = Asales + DateIntroduced + Asales * DateIntroduced + other factors + Errors\n\nWhere your \"Asales * DateIntroduced\" is an interaction term that captures the casual effect of the introduction of your product into a respective market.",
            "You might want to take a look at multivariate time series",
            "I agree with Ocelot. If you wanted to, you could plot the cumulative sale of old and cumulative sale of new on the same plot (two lines overlapping) and consider each individual store to see which prefer old vs new. If it\u2019s local, plot on a map which stores like the old vs new. Maybe there\u2019s regional favorability.\n\nYou could smooth your plots using a moving average \u2014 which points towards autoregression (auto ARIMA) but this seems to be overkill. You could just straight up slap a Gaussian process over it so you get an uncertainty measurement. However, what\u2019s likely more important is communicating the trends and performance of the new and old product rather than actually forecasting.",
            "30% r2 is basically nothing and it's hard to really say what's wrong without seeing the sales (time series). This was my field for 10 years, so I can be your huckleberry. \n\nYou may see 30% because you have two massive peaks of sales that aren't being fit. For this you need to account for trade/promotion/seasonality\n\nYou may see 30% because sales are increasing as you grow shelf presence, but have no variable to account for this (an average item fact will help). Or if due to increased number of stores sold a distribution fact will help. These may require smoothing if unstable week to week. \n\nIt could be a low fit because product level is too granular and it's just causing noise. Sub brand or brand level may be a more stable level of analysis. \n\nAnd there are a handful of additional ideas that may cause the low fit. It's truly hard to say without seeing the data. \n\nWith aggregated data you are not likely to find an interaction effect. Consumers don't just switch products in large numbers without some impetus (trade, lower price, media, etc.). This behavior is more noticable at a store level, but becomes very washed out at aggregate levels. This doesn't mean cannibalization doesn't occur, just that it's hard to see at an aggregate level. \n\nEdit: happy to help if you've got questions. If you DM me a screenshot of your sales I may be able to help more precisely (you can take away the x and y axis to make it more masked)."

Now I am working with pystan and orbit for bayesian time series. In my previous unit we were using Spark for big data.\n\nWe don't explicitly use R, but reading lots of publications and also consider using R or reimplementing some algos in Python in case they are available only in R.\n\nI try to avoid MS Power BI as a plague, but unfortunately some clients have power bi frontend and we have to serve them, too. We also work for MicroStrategy frontends (this is the official dashboarding tool of the company). But if possible, we rather push Dash because of its flexibility and also because it is just Python.\n\nI also keep my Cython and C++ skills alive, so that I can write some fast algorithms for Python; but usually we just use Python. In case you are considering learning further languages, probably a little R doesn't hurt (so that you can understand scientific publications); JavaScript can be useful if you happen to develop some frontends for your projects; and learning some Cython and C++, or perhaps Rust with PyO3 are possible options. But they are absolutely not a necessity, you can survive solely with Python and numba in most places.\n\nTL;DR: I propose to keep focusing on Python, and learn Python really well (read books like Fluent Python, Robust Python, Fast Python by T. R. Antao; High Performance Python; Cython by Kurt W. Smith; learn proper OOP, threading etc.). Keep one eye on Mojo \ud83d\udd25 because it is a possible future (of Python). Focus on ML/DL libraries, e.g. sklearn, sktime and nixtla for time series, pytorch for deep learning. Also take a look at JAX. Plotly/Dash is very important. And! Learn your IDE really well. There is a 5 hours tutorial for VSCode from FreeCodeCamp on YouTube, check that out. :)\n\nTL;DR2: also learn and practice git really well. It takes time to get used to its advanced features, and it is essential to be fluent with it. Also learn TDD, testing with pytest. Get used to virtual environments, I use venv. Previously using conda was widespread, nowadays we also experiment poetry.

        "content": "Hi people of reddit,\n\nI have been looking for a job as a Data Scientist for the last year or so. In the meantime, I have been taking up some freelance work and classes on the side (dataquest, datacamp) to improve my skills.\n\nFor context, I am a Mathematician, and graduated from my Ph.D. a few years back. I finished my post-doc last August. I know how to write code in R, SQL and Python, and I am confident (most of the time) in my ability to learn. I am very familiar with statistical concepts (although I did not specialise in it) and I have exposure to ML algorithms. Over the last year or so, I have applied for over 500 roles, getting into \\~50 interviews. In the end, I got exactly 2 offers, one of which I accepted a few days ago.\n\nI have to say that this last year has been crappy (to say the least). Every company boasts about its inclusivity plan, which (don't get me wrong) is very much needed. However, my point here is that people with a background in academia are generally, and from my own experience, not included at all.\n\nSome doctorate programmes have seminars that aim to ease the hypothetical transition to the industry, while, in truth it should be the other way around. As a former academic, I do not seek favourable treatment, not at all (and if I come off as such, it is a mistake that is solely on me). I do not expect people to rely on the fact that I have degrees and hire me immediately. I understand that it's a \"tough market\" and a \"numbers' game\". I just have to say that it feels that all the weight is put on work experience, while in truth it is perhaps an overrated characteristic.\n\nI should not have to prove my ability to learn, adapt and apply. I should not have to prove my ability to mentally keep up with all kidns of hardship, from day one, all the way to graduation. I should not have to prove how adaptable and resilient people from academia are. I should not have to prove my ability to juggle dozens of responsibilities, all at once; nor my capacity to manage time, under a constant schedule made of deadlines. Are those not important anymore? Are those not crucial elements, honed through years of work experience?\n\nEmployers seem to care more about people using software A, rather software B and that's all it takes to get your application rejected. And here I am, thinking that they'd care about problem-solving (the big picture).\n\nIMHO, I should not get rejected because I do not have 3 years of experience for a junior data analyst position (true story).\n\nTo finish up, I was lucky, finding a job, even after 1 year of search. Excuse the emotional take; I am genuinely curious to see if more people see my point of view.\n\nCheers.\n\n**EDIT**: Wow! I never expected to have 100 comments to read/reply to. Hence, I feel obliged to provide a few clarification points:\n\n* I did my PhD, not in order to improve my CV, or land my DS dream job.  I did my PhD because I wanted to explore my craft, as much as I could.\n* I read quite a few valuable comments, and, to the people that took time to write them, thanks!\n* I want to say that, sincerely, I do not think that my PhD alone makes me better than other candidates. I even highlighted that take in my post. Naturally, I do feel I need to prove my worth, I know that. It is something that traditionally comes after 1-2 interviews, maybe in the form of a take-home task, or live coding session. What is the main point of my rant, is that my \"success rate\", defining \"success\" as \"invited for an interview\" is \\~1%, which, to me, is absurd.\n* Kudos to u/dfphd for expressing myself better than I did:  \"*why is it that hiring managers assume that someone with regular work experience has these attributes, while not giving someone in academia the same credit?*\" is the main question I have.",

I think too many people see it as an extension of an undergraduate degree, rather than what it actually is.\n\nThat being said, you don't actually have any experience in industry by the looks of it so I'm not sure you're in the best place to judge whether there's anything different or extra required to succeed in industry, as opposed to academia.\n\nI'd absolutely argue that there is. There are plenty of great, smart academic types who take time to adapt to the difference. I was one and I've seen enough of them.\n\nA PhD gives plenty of advantages that the equivalent number of years in industry generally don't. But that cuts the other way too.

            "I worked with two PhDs in the past. The first was brilliant. He could problem solve, apply logic to new problems, and rarely needed help of any kind. The second couldn't see the forest for the trees, needed constant hand-holding, and had to have simple ideas and concepts explained to him multiple times because he could not grasp something as straight-forward as \"we added X to Y, so that's why the old numbers aren't correct anymore.\" While I'm sure he could explain every bit of the math underlying a statistical model, he was next to useless in a practical setting to the point where he slowed down not only his own work but the work of others around him.\n\nMany years ago, I was part of a PhD program that I ended up leaving. I have seen firsthand that a PhD does not guarantee intelligence or competence. A PhD is what you make it. Plenty of intelligent people do not get PhDs. A PhD might raise the floor of expectations, but it's no guarantee of supreme competence and intellect. I think the only thing it unequivocally proves is an extreme (and, admittedly, admirable) dedication to the specific material the doctoral program covered. Nothing more.",

Basically we had a decent signal to label some queries in a somewhat automated way. Not all queries that were Type A were followed through with that button click though. Which is why I guess we built a model to try to generalize queries into Type A or not, even when no button clicking followed \u2014 we just had a set of queries where we were confident represented the positive class and marked everything else as not Type A\n\nAny help here on how people generally label data and think about model monitoring in classical ML would be greatly appreciated",

Like how would I know the precision or AUC ROC or AUC PR or RMSE is declining for a model in production unless new labels are in the pipeline and the model runs inference on newly labeled data?\n\nRight?\n\nThis is actually a hard problem. If you train a good model, it goes into production, and as part of the workflow *people fix issues the model identifies!* then you'd anticipate the model performs worse in production. Imagine you predict whether someone arriving to the ER is going to die in 12 hours, so you trigger a workflow to intervene. Clearly if people are dying less, you have a model success! But it looks like your model is failing... right?\n\n\nSome approaches\n\n1. Run your model in shadow mode until your collect a statistically meaningful sample in the production environment. \n\n2. Temporal comparison - pre/post incidence rates. This is unfortunately subject to sectoral dynamics -- an overall rate would mask baseline\n\n3. Use your prediction model as baseline (this is very common)\n\n4. Build a separate model for baseline incidence rates based on known factors (again, think hospital, % of capacity might non-monotonically impact death rates because people are too busy or have capacity to address risk of death)\n\nThere are several approaches, but what a wonderful problem to have that the models you produce affect the real world in a meaningful way!",
            "I don't work for Fiddler but they have some good notebooks that show how you'd set up monitoring for various model types: [https://docs.fiddler.ai/docs/quick-start](https://docs.fiddler.ai/docs/quick-start)\n\n&#x200B;\n\ntl;dr yes for supervised models there's typically a feedback loop that's driven by a data pipeline in production:  \ninputs are captured -> model makes a prediction -> eventually you can label that prediction -> compute model performance metrics over time  \n\n\nand if your model is unsupervised... all you're really monitoring is the data at that point",
            "The answer is it depends.\n\nAs an example I work in real estate rental estimation, we get new batches of data every week, this data is already labeled (aka we already have the rental price). I simply compile error metrics of our prediction versus the real price for this new data.\n\nWhen I used to work in predictive maintenance we only had sensor data from the equipment, if we had labels there would be no point in having a model, so what we monitored were metrics like number of alarms, time between alarms and others, we had performance metrics but those required labeling by maintenance engineers (aka the feedback on whether the alarm we issued was false or not).",
            "I don\u2019t think it is so much a model performing worse with successive training runs on new training data with labels, it\u2019s more a back-test kinda thing.\u00a0\n\nLike, say you predict a customer will churn, but they don\u2019t or they do, that real life result is recorded and at some interval reported as a summary stat with other predictions and outcomes for that model. So you\u2019re comparing RMSE or AUC or whatever from training, hold out, and from real life in production.\u00a0\n\nThen you set some threshold that triggers some set of actions to resolve model drift or unacceptable performance. Maybe it triggers a retraining pipeline with all the new data you\u2019ve since recorded. Maybe it reverts to an older version model that is more stable. Maybe it sets off alarms on lager duty and wakes data scientists up at 3am to start ad hoc experimentation and a complete rework of their research up to that point. You get the idea.\u00a0\n\nNot too different than any program or system really. I put new tires on my car. I check their condition regularly and reinforce to proper pressures. As I document them loosing pressure more rapidly (more frequent re inflation) I start the process of getting new tires, whatever that is.\u00a0\n\nIn a big mature company, I would expect a robust framework to exist for abstracting each step of the DS process in a production pipeline: data versioning, data quality monitoring, pipeline monitoring, feature stores with versioning and DQ, train-test split versioning and automation, training and model versioning, and so on. There would likely be a framework for monitoring testing of real life observed outcome compared to model predictions, recording those, and allowing recall into some system for management them.",

I do use my learning and development budget for those. But I don't care too much about the certificates. It's really about the content.\n\nThe Stanford AI courses are interesting and good, I'm not familiar with the ones you mention, but they might be as well. A lot of content is available freely online, but if your employer is happy to pay, you can have a somewhat elevated experience.\n\nA last point is that in my experience implicitly, if you're using L&D budget for it, that more or less also implies permission to spend some of your work time on it.

If you end up in really high paying roles, few companies will be able to beat that anyway and the interviews will be difficult. A lot of people stop job hopping because they get tired of the stress and preparation of interviews. And also after switching jobs a few times, ideally you end up somewhere good, and it doesn\u2019t make sense to leave just for the sake of leaving. \n\nPlus it\u2019s hard to get a promotion from your previous title as a new hire so if you want a more senior title you usually have to stick around long enough to get a promotion. I agree there\u2019s also value to being around long enough to do some long term end-to-end projects. \n\nSo I would say during the first ~5 years, job hop every 2 years or so, and then I\u2019d plan to stick around for 3-5 years, maybe longer if you land somewhere where you can grow and earn good pay.",
            "I got a job out of college as a DA. Got a 33% increase 3 months later by switching to a different company for a DE role (more like analytics engineer). I\u2019m very new but from what I\u2019ve read and heard it\u2019s a great idea early in your career.",

I\u2019m not saying you shouldn\u2019t, but I would say: make sure there is a reason besides higher pay when you change jobs.\n\nSome might not agree, but if you take a higher paying job that degrades your skillset, it probably isn\u2019t worth it. And make sure that the bump is worth it.\n\nFor example, if you\u2019re making 120K, I wouldn\u2019t hop to a job that gets 130. Look for 140 or 150+. And make sure that you\u2019re growing in the role or company.\n\nWhether you have issues with your current employer or are looking to explore something new, it helps to have a reason beyond pay to move jobs. It will help you explain moves to potential employers and also help you evaluate if a potential move is really right for you.\n\nPersonally wouldn\u2019t hop before reaching 1 year, 1.5-2 years early career seems standard (when I say early career, I mean maybe 2-6 years out of university or whatever background you come from). I agree with the other comment that says a high-level leadership role is not going to hire a job hopper - once you want to be a manager/senior manager/director, if that\u2019s the track you aspire to, you need to prove that you can stick around and make a business impact, not just deliver technical projects. You need to show that you can stick around long enough to learn the ins and outs of the business, develop relationships with stakeholders and executives, and be a person that the org can rely on for leadership and strategic growth.",

Even so, data scientists can get away with a bit more because they rarely need to integrate their stuff with with other teams to the extent of a backend engineer.\n\nGood software practices imo lead to better science in general. The whole idea behind stuff like SOLID is having your work be more extensible and reproducible. I personally fiddle around in notebooks first (approx. coding with a debugger that is always on) and then I formalise it in .py/.R files.\n\nGit is one of the most important tools out there as well. At this point I don't think I could work with people that don't use it properly. I would coach them because it's an essential skill that would make their life easier/more hassle free. Depending on the project basic testing + CI/CD also makes a huge difference insofar that I feel a lot more free to ... do science / experimentation while knowing I have a safety net. Even for more analyst type people there is value - personally I like dashboarding tools that have a YAML layout of the UI and data that is used. That way you can version control the dashboards you make.\n\nWhere it frequently goes wrong in my experience is when some data scientists need to do tasks that such as making a web app (streamlit, shiny, dash, ...), simple data engineering pipeline or algorithm R&D. This is not ad-hoc stuff, for example it might have a long shelf life, requirements that change or you might need to reproduce experiments of 2 months ago.\n\nEDIT: A big one I forgot: **always** type hint new code (function params and return values). The effort to write them is 0. They're a cheap form of documentation that helps you when developing."

However, they may then end up with rather contrived results. We can ask two questions here:\n\n1. What experimental set up did they use to determine the 97% accuracy? The experimental design puts the metric into context.\n2. Are they using \"accuracy\" as a data scientist, or the more loose interpretation for a lay audience? The latter is more likely.\n\nHere is the paper that discusses this dog sniffing unit at VGH:\n\n* [https://ipac-canada.org/photos/custom/CJIC/CJIC\\_Summer2019\\_Li.pdf](https://ipac-canada.org/photos/custom/CJIC/CJIC_Summer2019_Li.pdf)\n* [https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0195670117302955](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0195670117302955)\n\nThey are not claiming that dogs are able to detect C. difficile in any given situation, at least if we dig beyond this billboard. The dogs are being used in a hospital, which reduces the imbalance from that general population. They only go to areas of high risk, further reducing the imbalance. They also only go to locations where recent clusters of C. difficile where detected.\n\nTheir control is scented pads, which we can discuss if they are representative given the potential difference in \"scent potency\" between pads and whichever other surface.\n\nI think it is important to understand that results presented to the general public are going to use more loose definitions. It is also important to understand how the population of interest was defined, since that will help us get a better estimate of the imbalance."

I would be required to be at the office about 50% of the time and attendance is tracked using some app. The tech stack is somewhat out of date but modernizing it would be part of my tasks. Here I could learn a lot about several different domains of machine learning and data science. \n2. Position 2 is at a former startup which was recently bought by a larger company. I would have 100% wfh and a very modern tech stack, however my work would focus strongly on a very narrow range of models which are interesting to one single industry. However, this company is basically a software company so that I could learn a lot about software development and ML engineering. \n\nSo what position would you take? I tend towards position 1 because I liked doing research at university (did my PhD in math) but position 2 seems to have better benefits and engineering is interesting as well? Also I think the skills I learn at position 1 are more valuable when switching jobs again, but I'm not sure about that. \n\nWhat would be the key factors you are looking for when considering a new position? \n\nThank you all in advance. \n\nEdit: for reference, I'm living in Europe and have worked as a data scientist for four years, currently being a senior DS.

The directive we receive is, \"Hey, data scientists and AI experts, we know machine learning can be used for fraud detection, so save us X millions of dollars using machine learning.\" However, when we investigate closely, we find many discrepancies. The only commonality between the types of fraud in our organization and the types of fraud where machine learning is successfully used is the word \"fraud.\" The manager either doesn't understand or doesn't want to understand. This has been happening for close to three years (even before I joined the company). It's a large organization with data scattered everywhere and many quality issues. We also don't receive many requirements from the business. I'm used to receiving a business requirement and then working with the business to determine if there's a machine learning use case, and then proceeding from there, justifying each step. However, the manager wants us to randomly come up with a use case and then go and talk to stakeholders. Does that ever work in a large organization? Most of the time, we don't even get a reply from them because they are too busy. It's even difficult to determine what is worth working on without involving the business from the beginning. The business is going to be the ultimate entity that implements our solution, so how can we do it without getting buy-in upfront? Do you have any experience navigating this kind of situation?

It is just simply not going to be the case that for every initiative you get clear requirements from the business- mainly because they aren\u2019t experts in your field, like you (how would they even know what an ML opportunity even looks like\u2026?) \n3) Generally speaking, at all levels of DS you should still only pursue something concretely if it makes sense and will add value to the business- or, make your reservations known, disagree, and then do it anyways, and give 100%. In industry your leadership has the last word. \n4) in general , most of your projects should have buy in before you spend lots of time and a clear path to market- talk to other teams if thats not the case - goals help here\n5) Crucially in DS- not all projects should be like this. You need to be 1-2 steps ahead of the business - that means not everything is fully specced. / could be foundational\n6) Lastly, remember- you are part of the business. In DS , your role is a bit unusual in that if you want to succeed and add value, you should NOT always just \u201cdo what you are asked\u201d (ex-my above, imo) At the core you are a problem solver - that means in general it\u2019s sometimes necessary to identify opportunities and get after them - whether others see them yet or not.

Data Science can never work without proper leadership and this is beyond the capacity of data scientists at your level.\n\nSo you have two options, become extremely adept at your companies politics and ride the gravy train or leave your organisation."

Like if you do any sort of validation/hyperparameter tuning (which you should), **use a time-based split.** Random splitting is not enough for time-series modeling. [Here's the sklearn TimeSeriesSplit class](https://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/generated/sklearn.model_selection.TimeSeriesSplit.html), and [here's a good sklearn example illustrating different types of splitting](https://scikit-learn.org/stable/auto_examples/model_selection/plot_cv_indices.html#sphx-glr-auto-examples-model-selection-plot-cv-indices-py).\n\nThe standard tree-based models can't really extrapolate, so they won't be able to capture trends (unless you do some creative feature and/or label engineering).

Exploding all the arrays would have made the final table cumbersome to query and work with, so I just kept the structure as is.\n\nI parsed the JSON data and saved it as parquet with pyarrow. Once you've parsed the json string and have a list of dictionaries, you create and save it in tabular form.\n\nWe're using AWS and querying the data with Athena is really quick and easy. Athena can handle JSON files as well but I had mixed data types in some fields so needed to clean the data first, and parquet is more efficient to store and query.",
            "Shaking my head at all the people suggesting Spark to \"efficiently\" flatten a few JSON files... I wrote a job like this a while ago. You want to use a cursor-based streaming JSON parser like jsoniter or simdjson. If you don't know beforehand what fields will be included in the data, then you need to keep track of field names and their column index in the output file. Use software transactional memory or a lockless data structure to synchronize column order among concurrent parsers and cache columns you've already seen (since their index will never change, no cache invalidation is needed). You will only know what columns are needed in the output after having parsed the entire document, so a second pass over the output file is needed to backfill unseen columns. In my case the output was CSV and the monotonic nature of the column index cache makes sure that unseen columns are always at the end of the row where they can be easily backfilled. If you need a columnar output format instead of row, then it will probably be more difficult. The key to speed is to minimize allocations and data copying as much as possible."

I'm modeling on a large dataset using random forest. I get strong evaluation scores (R-squared of \\~0.85) on a preliminary run on the training set with no hyperparameter tuning, however, when I introduce cross-validation and hyperparameter tuning, I end up with something like 0.20 for my best model. \n\nMy guess is that this indicates overfitting, but are there any other issues that I may be concerned with? My understanding is that overfitting is much less common in random forest models-- with my dataset being pretty large, would this just indicate that the data are highly noisy?

If you didn't, then the 0.8 value is unreliable and is probably overfitting a lot and if you test that model on a different dataset it will perform poorly.\n\nWhen you then performed cross validation and hyperparam tuning, you said your R2 became 0.2. I'm assuming that is your validation score, which is more reliable than the training score.\n\nIt's pretty clear your first model was overfitting. However, it's no longer clear if your new CV tuned models are overfitting or underfitting because we need more information about the hyperparameters being tuned, their search space, the training and validation scores for the CV model, etc.",

You ask about noise-- that's something you should know long before trying any model, or even attempting to define features in the data.\n\nIf there is noise-- or possibly the curse of dimensionality-- you will want to consider if dimensionality reduction (e.g., principal components analysis) can be used.\n\nOverall, you need to figure out what questions to pose to the data...

            "I'd assume that knowledge, skills, and experience generally increase up the levels. I think everyone broadly understands that. So aside from that, the main (simple) differentiators are:\n\nJunior: Has some skills and knowledge but needs a lot of direction in their work. As in, they're largely told what to do, how to do it, and rely on more senior colleagues for reviews and guidance.\n\nMid: increased skills and knowledge but now has the experience to be much more independent. Will still be told what to do by others but can, largely, tackle the \"how\" failry independently and relies minimally on more senior colleagues for reviews and guidance. Can also start inputting more on work outside their immediate sphere and contribute to broader discussions.\n\nSenior: increased skills and knowledge again, and, compared to a mid, a level of experience that allows them to direct what they do, not just how they do it. They can drive the work in their area and direct the work of more junior colleagues. Can begin inputting into discipline or team wide issues. Also can act as a guide for more junior colleagues, providing mentorship, reviewing work or guidance as appropriate.\n\nFor someone with significant experience in a related area and enough skills and knowledge to get a DS role in the first place, I'd have thought that a mid role is more appropriate than junior, but that would depend on the person.\n\nI don't think there's a definite list of skills or knowledge that spectate the levels. A Junior DS could know far more about a specific implantation of NLP than a Senior, for example, but still be a junior because they don't have the experience of developing and deploying models in the \"real world\".",

        "content": "It is very clear to me that I am one of the least competent data scientists at my company, if not the one (For context, I have worked here for 1 year, having worked 2 years before as a DA), but I know it is not simply a matter of imposter syndrome. \n\nWhen I was hired as a JDS, most of my colleagues were data analysts and my responsibilities were mostly similar to theirs (basically SQL and BI), I think I did an okay job and managed to get a promotion to regular DS. Things changed, and I was moved to a team of experienced DSs. There I will be expected to do much less data analysis and more development. Now I noticed the big skill gap and how undeserving I was of my promotion. I am extremely intimidated by my colleagues' large knowledge of our codebase (and of theory in general), and by their awareness of recent relevant papers. I also suck at networking and have a very poor knowledge of who knows/does what in the company, which everyone else seems to do well. I also don't have great presentation skills, mostly due to my lack of knowledge and subsequent insecurity. \n\nI know that I need to catch up, but I don't really understand how. I try to pay a lot of attention to everything that is written or said in meetings, but that almost never makes sense to me as I don't have the context. I also can never add to any meeting unless we are discussing something very close to what I have worked on. At this point, I feel super ashamed as I need to take care of one specific model that I know almost anything about. Its performance is bad and I can't figure out how to start. I am supposed at least to diagnose the model's failures but I have way too little knowledge to even figure out what to do. I could follow someone's instructions well if I had them. But as a DS I should be able to do that by myself. I know very well that working with smarter people is great for my career and that I shouldn't listen to my inner voice that tells me I should have stayed a DA. Still, I feel that I don't have the behavioral skills to take advantage of that the best way as I am introverted and have ADHD.   \n\n\nI identified that my lack of attention is an issue and I am making a conscious effort to pay more attention. I am quite self-conscious and afraid of making questions, which is something I am trying to change, but at a big effort to me. So I wonder if you guys have any general hints/suggestions on how to improve faster. ",

Tried very hard but it was same situation like you, I couldn't understand even after trying hard. i was very slow and my solutions were never the best ones. my colleague was decently good and had theory knowledge and I felt very low. i wad very confused where to start how to start how to up my ds knowledge. started actively listening to podcasts of latest developments, articles, etc. Whenever I got a problem statement I spent extra time on studying the algorithm which can be used to solve. eventually i started grasping the basic ML knowledge and wanted to learn even deeper. Started reading books and more podcasts, research papers (with help of chatgpt and bard) now I feel I have decent theory knowledge.\n\nThis is what I do whenever I get something to work on (not necessarily in sequence)\n- i start to research on problem\n- i also learn about the approaches which can be used (for eg read deeply on LSTMs if it is a problem which can be solved by LSTM , time series problems for eg)\n- what are research papers available on that topic (make sure u take it slow, don't try to finish everything in 1 go, understanding is the key)\n- start experimenting, \"theory can only take u so far\"\n- yeah and keep learning even on weekends",
            "If you feel overwhelmed, the best thing you can do is concentrate on something smaller and try to do that well to gain confidence. You still sound very inexperienced as a DS. It's natural that you'll feel behind others in a range of areas. Concentrate on diagnosing what's wrong with this model. Treat it first as an analysis task without worrying too much about ML theories or concepts. And ask for help if you need it. If more experienced colleagues can't help you then that's a fault on their part, not yours.",
            "It\u2019s tricky because from one side you\u2019re sitting on a gold mine of knowledge and from the other you need to perform for your role. \n\nI would say understand the expectations of yourself within your team and step out of your comfort zone.\n\nAs you progress up you\u2019ll be around even more intimidating ppl like stakeholders and C Suite level members. Enter those environments with curiosity and humility. If you don\u2019t understand something, try to get your doubts clarified. If you\u2019re struggling with the technicals ask for some reading material. \n\nWe all have moments of intense imposter syndrome because most of the time you are the technical specialist/SME but don\u2019t be afraid to say \u201cI\u2019m sorry I don\u2019t understand\u201d because the more you avoid those conversations the more confused you\u2019ll get and the more you\u2019ll feel like an imposter. \n\nLike many of us on this sub I started off at my company as one of the very few data scientists in the company so I never got the opportunity to ask someone directly. Trust me when I say that getting someone to explain a concept to you in person is a golden experience.\n\nDon\u2019t let your emotions or ego prevent you from accepting yourself and improving."

While it's nice that they flag potential problems with the data and even provide some analytical value for variable relationships, it seems more like a coding time saver than anything, which AI has proven to help with to a degree.\n\nAn analyst still needs to go back and look at the report with a very critical eye. If designed well, the automatic EDA significantly reduces the amount of review an analyst may conduct. But as always, the real challenge is contextualizing these EDA results for more meaningful modeling, prediction, or inference. If designed poorly, the automatic EDA can provide a false sense of comfort, giving the analyst a feeling that they don't need to dig in. \n\nFwiw, I could see your research adding to the tool kit of these automatic EDA packages. Perhaps there is some room to develop more around missingness, for example. But that's just a cursory thought.",

At least in companies that know/knew how to use data science and AI efficiently. The next big thing is just making people more aware of that.\n\n**If you are looking for the \"next big thing\"**\n\nIt is likely to be less data, better generalisation. Few-shots, one-shot, zero-shot architectures in any domain. LLMs are already big and popularised the so called few-shot learning but it's been around for quite some time now."

        "content": "When we have such a simple neural network, where we have all neurons of the hidden layer, receiving exactly the same input and the same number of inputs (nth features), from the previous layer. Will it be right to say that the only reason of using multiple neurons in the hidden layer is to initialize random weights and/or biases to all neurons, just so we avoid getting trapped into some local minima? Or are there other reasons of using multiple neurons?  I do understand that there could be several reasons to use multiple neurons, but my question is specifically for the neural network shown in image above. \n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/xr0pn64dpxdb1.png?width=804&format=png&auto=webp&s=6d19a3f6f2c9c82ef92ffcaa66a6ff6c04467202",
        "comments": [
            "The reason is fairly superficial actually. Using more nodes means the neural net can learn more intricate patterns. One way of adding more nodes is to add more layers, and another is to add more nodes to an existing layer. Adding more layers corresponds to searching for higher order interactions, while widening a layer corresponds to searching for a larger number of interactions of that same order.\n\nIn this specific example, the network is designed to take a 2D space and decompress it into 3 features. Then it compresses that back down to 2D. In a binary classification task, this might mean that the classes overlap in the input space but are separated by a not-particularly-bendy boundary in the correct 3D space. You need to have that 3-node layer in order for the model to figure out that 3D boundary. But since it\u2019s not particularly curvy, you presumably only need the one hidden layer to describe that boundary.",
            "The rationale for the number of neurons has no direct connection to initialization procedures, at least as far as I am aware.\n\nAs far as why you would want more - or less - neurons, its just about model complexity and how that relates to the bias (in the bias-variance sense) of your learning algorithm.\n\nBy way of example, consider the problem of building a network to approximate the XOR function. It is well known that this function [cannot be approximated by a network with a single hidden node](https://datascience.stackexchange.com/a/11590), and that the [XOR function is not linearly separable](https://ai.stackexchange.com/a/25234).\n\nHopefully this illustrates that our choice of the number of hidden nodes allows us to adjust the total complexity of the function our model may reasonably approximate.",
            "Basically what others said - cannot fit complex patterns. To get a feel why/how (simple) neural networks are fitting patterns, is to play a bit with the Tensorflow Playground:\n\nhttp://playground.tensorflow.org/\n\nTry different datasets, different features. Start with just 1 hidden layer and 1 neuron then progressively add more neurons and layers. Image on each node will represent a pattern that each neuron learned.",
            "I'm sure there is some paper or book explaining it but from just using neural networks you need a decent number in your hidden layers. \n\nYou could try it for yourself. Find a simple problem that gives good results with just one small hidden layer and then see what happens when you reduce or increase the number of neurons. \n\nIt should be under or overfit.",
            "A neural Network is actually a layer-wise composition of ensembles of non-linear functions. In plain english this means that each non-linear activation learns to model some aspect of the data. You want many of those in each layer such that they learn to model large relevant parts of the feature space because each nonlinearity will learn its own perspective. They all share the same input connections because they are like a panel of Experts finding a unified decision on a complex Matter. They all need to see the full previous layer's activation. These nonlinearities are then linearly combined specifically to a single Neuron in next layer that 'listens' to all of these experts' opinions before forming its own again, repeating the above."

            "I agree with pretty much everything the other commenters have said. I will also added that it's a lot of first principles thinking combined with research and leverage other people's learning.\n\nOften times, I find it best to envision the \"idealized\" data collection setup and workflow and then work backwards to the most realistic option based on the data and pipelines and workflow we actually have.\n\nFor example, let's take your churn prediction use case. It depends a lot on how you want to use this. For example, are you trying to analyze the data so you can gather insights about the population?\n\nOr is your goal to try and have a predictive model that will tell you which customers should be targeted with some intervention?\n\nIf it's the latter, then you can build a general framework for how to solve problems like that.\n\nLet's say we have some intervention that we can take, such as reaching out to a customer and offering them a proactive discount on their upcoming renewal.\n\nThen in a perfect world, we want two models. \n\nOne model predicts the future long term profits (customer lifetime value) of a particular customer if we were to do nothing.\n\nThe other model predicts the counterfactual which would be the future long term profits (CLV) of a particular customer IF we were to intervene and offer them a discount. So, in other words:\n\nM1 = E(CLV | do(nothing))\n\nM2 = E(CLV | do(intervention))\n\nNow you can go through every customer and calculate (M2 - M1) which is the causal impact on expected profits if you were to intervene and offer that proactive discount.\n\nNow you can simple take the highest impact/ROI customers and intervene on them.\n\nI think this is often the \"ideal\" way to approach these targeted/personalized user interventions to produce an impact on some important metric like expected profits.\n\nThere can be lots of caveats, for example you can't really estimate the interventional expectation on purely observation data. So ideally you want to perform some randomized controlled trial or A/B test to ideally collect training data or at the very least use it to test out your models trained on historical observational data.\n\nYou'll notice that this type of framework can be applied to many different problems, not just churn use cases.",
            "You start with \"why do customers churn ?\" look for answers in data and you will find more questions, step by step you will find solutions.",
            "I had an upper co-worker who was a really talented SWE, sadly he was really mind toasted when it came down to machine learning techniques.\n\nAll he saw was Random Forest everywhere. It worked, but there were other methods who could get the job done without having to do a shit ton of booleans classifications. Sometimes a simple kNN or logistic regression made the trick, but due to its dependence on RF all DS projects which didn\u2019t include it were\u2026 not considered worth trying by him.\n\nHe was really really nice tho. It was just he internalized a single method for a field were nothing can be segment as a rule. Just try to approach things the way you bet they\u2019d go, but be really open about all flaws your method might have and look for alternatives that\u2019d better feed your task\u2019s needs."

The sim was in c++ and most mathematical analysis was written from scratch in c/c++. I'm now about a year into a postdoc which is focused on subject matter very closely related to my thesis work, and also dealing with very large and complex data sets. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nI have come to realize recently that I'm satisfied with my contributions to science, and I am unsatisfied with how financially far behind I am relative to most people my age (lot of student debt, no retirement, no racecar, etc.).  I'm ready to move on. In addition to my very unique computational and data management/analysis experience, I have some light ML experience and worked for a few years as a SWE for a DoD contractor (prior to grad school). I do not have SQL experience, and my python game is meh but getting better.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nI know FAANG is notoriously hard to break into - anyone here made the transition from hardcore computational STEM to FAANG DS, or any other very high paying DS role? Is it realistic to pursue research based ML roles with only minor past ML experience given my rather unique skills/experience? Any advice on making the transition or skills I should be adding to my resume before I start spamming applications in the coming months?\n\nthanks in advance!\n\n&#x200B;",

One thing to remember is that management is only interested in one thing - $dollars$. So you need to think of how your project will 1) make money 2) save money, or 3) save time, which is equivalent to 2). As part of the planning process, try to come up with metrics that can be converted to money terms. If possible collect baseline data to measure progress against. Avoid projects where the benefits cannot be readily demonstrated to management, or you will lose credibility.",

But it can also be other metrics like customer satisfaction improvement.\n\nIn any case, whenever we are developing a DS project, we're having this in mind and we're putting in place a monitoring system. It logs the needed metrics allowing us to automatically calculate on monthly basis the impact of our different projects.\n\nResults are presented in a dashboard that allow us to easily showcase the value of the team to top management.",

This is dollar-equivalent except since salaries are often unequal the actual dollar impact is only really known by HR and management.\n\nEverything else falls into these 2 categories.

            "Weird things can happen in large organizations where middle managers find that their influence and sometimes their paycheck is tied to the headcount that they manage. So you'll encounter resistance to automate even when it would save a lot of money because a middle manager is worried about what it means for them.\n\nIn 2001, I had a summer temp job for a company where the sales people would manually write down people's credit card numbers and then my job was to punch it into a credit card terminal. Hundreds of credit cards per day (it's how I got really good at 10-key). There were at least three of us who did nothing but punch credit card numbers all day. It was the dumbest job ever, but it paid $15/hr which was decent money for a summer temp gig in 2001 (SF Bay Area before the Dot Com bust) so I was fine with it. It beat the hell out of working at PetSmart for $6.35/hr, which is what I had done the previous summer. \n\nAnyway, there's no good reason why they couldn't have had the sales people type in the credit card numbers and then run them automatically. But my jackass of a middle manager resisted because he'd have fewer employees if it were automated (I think the excuse was security concerns, which made no sense). And the head of the IT backed him up because they drank and god knows what else together. \n\nAll of which is to say there are a lot of morons out there. But at the same time there are good bosses too, so find a new job with one of those. \n\nIn terms of getting better at interviews, just keep applying until it works out. I've bombed plenty of interviews in my day, so learn whatever you can from bad ones and focus on the next one. My best advice there is to go line-by-line through the job posting and have an anecdote ready that speaks to all of the core responsibilities. If it's a well-designed interview protocol (admittedly not always the case), there shouldn't be any question that comes out of the blue if you've studied the job posting. Keep your answers to 30-45 seconds and practice your delivery in front of a mirror. Use ChatGPT to help give you feedback on responses to generic behavioral interview questions.\n\nWhen I interview candidates, my first filter is \"will this person be a pain in the ass to work with?\" If I pick up on that vibe, you're unlikely to advance. Secondly, I'm interested in evaluating whether they're self-aware enough and honest about the bounds of their knowledge. BTW, it's totally acceptable to say, \"I don't know\" and is often preferable to listening to really bad bullshit for several minutes.",
            "Find some common soft skills questions online and just start making up scenarios. Write/type them out and start memorizing. Yes it\u2019s technically lying but your answer is reflective of how you actually behave, so it\u2019s really more of white lie. The question that I always struggle with is \u201cmention a time you failed and how you reacted\u201d. Honestly, I can\u2019t think of a time where I truly failed to produce some sort of project/work so I like to make something up.\n\nInterviews in general are about presenting yourself in an easily digestible way to the interviewer. It\u2019s okay to fudge the truth to make them understand who you are.\n\nSo the question about managing stakeholders. One way to answer that would be \n\n\u201cwhen working with multiple stakeholders, communication is key. Especially on larger projects with eight or more stakeholders, it\u2019s important to establish some sort of agreed upon method of communication. This could be a slack channel, email etc. As work is accomplished, it\u2019s important to update people to help them understand that progress is or isn\u2019t being made. Additionally, it helps to have some sort of documentation available such as a confluence page. All of this serves to manage expectations and assuage any fears that a deadline won\u2019t be met or that the requirements will not be fulfilled.\u201d\n\nBut a lot of your post seems to be frustration with not having or being allowed to use hard skills. For that, you should probably do personal projects and build out a portfolio.",

            "I think this is a question I\u2019ve been asking myself a lot lately. Like others have mentioned, there\u2019s lots of DS jobs which involve operations research/optimization type of work. \n\nAlongside this, with an MS in Statistics I\u2019ve seen a lot of jobs involving causal inference and experimentation. My hope is that these DS jobs will become more technical as applying causal inference techniques as it is are still in its primitive stages and there\u2019s always more that can be done. A DS with a good grounding in how to answer causal questions could be useful if one knows these methods and their drawbacks in practice. \n\nExperimental design is a topic which is of great importance for statisticians, and maybe a statistician with knowledge of optimal experimental design or various design procedures for active learning in online experiments can be useful. Another job which I hope (fingers crossed) is out there that maybe I\u2019m not seeing are maybe some sort of marketing ds teams or some area of ds which involves lots of Bayesian analysis, maybe there\u2019s issue with small sample sizes and here DS who can leverage Bayesian methods are useful here. \n\nI\u2019m hoping there\u2019s more roles out there which are less about deep learning but more about using what we can from elements of statistical learning theory for predictive modeling. I find lots of DS just default to an xgboost or random forest without thinking about different ways to think about the problem and leverage some of the methods in this book.\n\nFor example, you can build an ensemble of *anything* not just decision trees (which are random forests), maybe a role which involves more creativity in predictive modeling is a role which I hope more DS teams would value.\n\nI also personally believe that there\u2019s no point in hiring data scientists if you don\u2019t let them experiment/explore with the data you have. If you are just gonna put people with advanced degrees in statistics/econometrics/math/physics/engineering in a box and not let them use tools in their arsenal, then maybe you should just hire product managers and coach them up on SQL if that\u2019s all you really need.\n\nFor me personally, I\u2019m trying to decide if I should stick it out with my MS in Statistics and maybe try and switch to a more technical DS role, or go for a PhD in Statistics. Latter I\u2019m not too certain about cause I really want money, but I\u2019m okay with a more technical DS job which gives the scientific rigor that\u2019s in a PhD if that makes sense.",

            "As others have said there are some data analytics entry level jobs. However, when the budget tightens a lot of companies don't want or need entry-level folks. An entry-level data analyst is someone that you hope to grow with. You want to keep them around for at least a few years because it's going to take them 3 months just to find out where the bathroom is and how to pull data and they won't really be productive until about 6 months.\n\nWhen companies start growing and expanding more you're going to see a greater number of entry level jobs opening up. Right now new grads are just dealing with the business cycle we happen to be in. I remember hitting the market in Tech right after the dotcom bust and that was a nightmare too. I had to take on an administrative assistant job because I couldn't find any developer position that would accept entry level. I actually turned that into a data position once they discovered that I can write SQL.",
            "Data analyst job titles have become a catch all for everything ranging from data analysis to business intelligence reporting, to data engineering/ETL, to Analytics engineering, to data modeling, to data science.\n\nYou have to read the actual job description (assuming it\u2019s correct) or you really have no idea what the job truly entails.\n\nThere are data analysts out here making 200k+ I work with a lot of them, there are junior data scientists making 60k I used to work with alot of them.\n\nBut, you have an unrelated degree, no internships and one project of course you struggling to break into the field it\u2019s one of the most competitive fields out there. \n\nSerious question for you why would a hiring manager select you over anybody else with a relevant degree and/or experience? Statistics and a single project isn\u2019t even trying if we\u2019re being honest.\n\nPersonally I would look for analyst roles within the social science that your degree is in most have some level of SQL, data analysis, Etc that will help you jump over eventually.",
            "Look for similar roles in which your skills as social scientist would be useful. For instance, market research, data analytics in a non-profit or political campaign, look for places running surveys and the different positions they have. You can also look at international organizations like UN, world bank, WHO, etc, they usually have young professional programs."

            "Python is probably the most valuable language for an engineer today. I used to say it was a tie between JS and Python, but now it\u2019s a clear win for Python. \n\nThe language is also one of the easiest to learn and work with, IMO. I think you can pick up 70% of Python in a few weeks IF you learn with a hands on project. This means finding something similar to your job, and build it. Grab some Github samples that are close and engineer your own iteration. Don\u2019t be nervous to use AI to help - CoPilot will steer you in the right direction 98% of the time with Python, and it can help you memorize things you\u2019d otherwise not. \n\nR is a similar story. It\u2019s not a tough language to pick up, and it\u2019s growing even faster with AI\u2019s rise in the open source world. You should be using R in whatever learning project you decide on, too. \n\nIf you can pick up a ton of Python in a few weeks - enough to get by at the new job - then you\u2019ll need about twice that to feel semi-comfortable with R, IMO. I think the basics of R are easier than Python, but real use case for R is more difficult than Python. \n\nYou can do a lot with Python basics; not so with R. You\u2019ll need to understand more advanced R to be effective. \n\nEither way, you\u2019ll be fine. Consider it a challenge. Dominate it, and you\u2019ll thank yourself in a few years.

            "A database architect doesn't necessarily need to know any programming (depending on responsibilities) but a data engineer certainly does. I think you need to get rid of the titles and figure out exactly what the team / manager / department needs. If you are maintaining databases then you are on call, right? That would be good to know. If you are building new databases then you need to work on mapping data relationships, defining schemas, choosing tools and so on (what I would call a data architect). But if you are going to manage and optimize existing databases then it's a different set of skills you need to dive into (the great thing about SQL is that we can use it for analytics without knowing much about the internals of databases). And it's also possible that they just want you to do analytics on existing databases without ownership and they are just using weird terminology. Bringing up Tableau suggests analytics since a data architect or data engineer would usually not have anything to do with Tableau. Python and R for analytics is nice. Tableau becomes easier when you are familiar with tidy data from R (long data) but as long as you know what normalization is in SQL you should be good.\n\nEdit: Don't Panic."

They ended up talking about how they progressed at the company starting out, the overall tasks they had, and what they were doing now as they have progressed. Both graduated school in 2015.\n\nBoth of them talked about their entry level data science job, as follows:\n\n\u201cPanelist 2 and I were both hired here at the consulting firm, and at the time another consultant was starting a \u201cAI Transformative Technologies lab\u201d that was just in its infancy. As fresh graduates, with out backgrounds we got by far our dream job. Panelist 2 and I were basically, from 8-5 everyday, were printing out stacks of deep learning papers, and building industry specific case studies for deep learning. In consulting, you often have many different clients for different industries, so we spent just everyday, building out a portfolio of case studies where we applied SOTA deep learning models, and pitched them to clients in each industry. Overall a dream job where we combined deep learning research with client facing presentations\u201d.\n\nAll in all, sounded like a dream job to me. Both of them worked 9 years, doing this, and then when I talked to them after, they both mentioned how they were now heading back to academia to do a PhD in statistics and the other a PhD in CS. At 31 years old, they are leaving this job, because they had moved up to a management level, and wanted to get back into deep learning again, and felt that academia and doing a PhD was where they felt they could succeed. \n\nI tell this story because sometimes I\u2019ve thought about this. I have an MS, but I know after a few years I\u2019m gonna miss the theoretical stuff I did in my MS, and will probably considering doing a PhD just for that. But something about that doesn\u2019t seem right. It feels that my motivation to go back to do a PhD is to \u201clearn more advanced stats\u201d so I can get away from managerial positions. Cause truthfully, I just don\u2019t really care about managing people, owning a product, or any of the corporate political BS that comes with moving up in a company. \n\nHas anyone else done a similar route to what those two panelists did?

            "It sounds like for them, it's a personal decision, not a career decision.\n\nIf they have so much experience, they can also finish their PhD pretty fast, like 4 years, because it sounds like they know what they want to focus about, the know most of the literature.\n\nThat said, I think many consulting firms are not at a high level in terms of their work. They weren't working at a FAANG. It sounds like they were doing POCs for clients and not actually implementing them. That's actually not that difficult to do. I think you are fantasizing that this job sounds amazing, but it would have been a good job for a short-term situation and it doesn't sound like they had mentors who could push the technical side.\n\nI'm not shocked in a consulting company the only track at this point is management. Personally, I think they should have (a) done a PhD way before, though, not do the 9 years of consulting because there's a point where you don't really improve by doing the same job for so long, (b) or they could have switched to another job doing something similar which could have helped with growth. \n\nProbably they were making a lot of money so they stayed there? I have a friend who worked at one of the big 4 making a lot of money, invested very well, then went for a PhD and now is a professor, but because he has a ton of money from investment and still does consulting on the side (which is more than his wages from being a professor), it's a good job for him and his lifestyle.",

            "As someone that has one and also worked in industry for a bit before pursuing one (only a couple years), Ph.D is a research degree. The only reason to do one is if you think you want a CAREER in publishing academic papers in journals.  Most Ph.D programs won't admit you if they think your goals are other wise. Most of those jobs are in academia, or  government. However, because there aren't enough academic jobs out there, it happens to be that a lot of Ph.Ds enter into industry. Its only recently, that was something that was looked as positive. It certainly wasn't that normal when I was graduating college (prior to 2010). CS and Stats might be a little bit more open to people pursuing Ph.D without an end goal of academia, but an my field it would certainly get your application thrown out if they felt that is t he case.\n\nThe financial costs of a Ph.D are enormous. I don't mean tuition, as most students get tuition waived and are paid a small stipend as part of a teaching assitant package. You are giving up 5 to 6 of your earning years and a lot of potential savings/investments. While most people don't pay a dime for Ph.D.  the amount of money lost from not holding a professional job is enormous, especially when you factor money lost by not investing (buying a house,retirement, stock market). You generally will not get this money back.\n\nSo why did  I not end up in academia?  Simply put it wasn't for me.The job market for academics is extremely competitive, and is often compared to trying to make it professional sports. This means that most people who go to academia are  happy to even get an academic job and you can't be picky about things like location, as the only academic job you might have in your hand might be in a liberal arts college in the middle of nowhere  or a college town in southern georgia. Then academic jobs are tiered. Most people want academic jobs at R1 universities  (which are about 100 places, which  have on average 1 opening a year). The reason is the pay is better, you will have better research support, will have opportunity to teach graduate student as opposed to disinterested undergrads, and you will teach less  (meaning more time to devote to serious research), at R1 universities the quality of research your judged on.  However, thats not most jobs. Most academic jobs are at small universities or satellite universities (think University of North Carolina Charlotte,  Northern Idaho college). These jobs will pay 2/3rd what an R1 will, require twice as much teaching. Pay is field dependent, but the lower end of pay can be as little as 70k. Then add to that 50 percent of people can't make tenure and then have to find a career other than academia. \n\nWhy do people even do these jobs? well a good chunk of Ph.Ds can't imagine doing anything other than being a professor."

Lately I feel increasingly disheartened about the type of work I'm asked to do, as well as the quality of work in data science generally. \n\nWhen I first started, to build a good model, whether predictive or inferential, I'd do research into the domain, come up with my own mental models and hypotheses of what actually shapes the behavior of your dependent variable, then knit together different quantitative methods to formalize the knowledge into a testable model. I had a lot of freedom over the \"backend\", and could build a custom tech stack and data pipeline tailored for the specific needs of the project.\n\nNowadays, with the dominance of GBDT and DL for predictive modeling, nothing really matters except scale, resources, and computing power. Optimization and compatability are all important so everyone ends up using the same models, the same tech, the same \"mlops\" frameworks. My previous job was working on an ASR model for a voice assistant at a big tech, which sounds cool to a lot of people, but in reality the actual work consisted of editing config files and making minor optimizations to different parameters. The only work that ever required brainpower was engineering work, not modeling work. I work at a much smaller company now but still, everything is about prebuilt tools and prebuilt models and prebuilt architectures.\n\nInferential analytics can still be fun, but it's increasingly rare with more business activity shifting online and thus A/B tests increasingly common. Plus, the quality/time bar on these projects keeps dropping - frankly because many new DS hires have limited knowledge/care about anything that's not ML, and will churn out very low quality output for analytics work. And increasingly I see people pumping out fishy analytics models just to get results that align with management/executive expectations. \n\nAnyone feel similarly?

Often, the end user only cares about one or two dimensions of direction, magnitude, precision, and significance. We need to adjust the minimally viable product to meet those needs, which often means determining significant direction of uncertain magnitude and precision. That's unsatisfying to many researchers with advanced degrees, but it's all about delivering a minimally viable product that meets the requirements of leadership. For example, many times they just need to know if the preponderance of the evidence indicates that policy X is good; they don't always need to know exactly how good it is and don't need the estimate to satisfy a 95% confidence level."

To have a feeling for that, plot the features against each other (using dimensionality reduction if necessary): can you see some clusters matching your class distribution? I have found that spending time on the data input (feature engineering) is often more worth it than randomly tweaking hyperparameters. \n\nIn your particular case, have you considered using hand-made features instead of the time series raw values?

For your case, I will just stack a RNN with a few linear layers), and have the pipeline running (reading data, transforming data, get the data into the model and generate outputs, compute the loss, and update the gradient).\n\nOnce you have the pipeline running, you modify your model into a full working model you want it to be. And start to train only on a subset of your data. You overtrain the model on a few batches and make sure the loss can converge to zero. \n\nThen you start to refactor your code and set aside those configurable parameters and make the pipeline more callable. \n\nThe key here is the fast feedback loop.

For instance:\n\n> tried linear regression (fitted many models and chose the best using the R squared adjusted, but the model was predicting an increase of \"y\" instead of a decrease)\n\n> For instance, it says that one of the variable positively affects \"y\" while physically it doesn't make sense.\n\nIt sounds like your takeaways from results like these are that you're just using the wrong model and a better model will give you what you want, but these results are telling you really important things about your data. There's almost certainly collinearity, nonlinearity, and interactions between features that could explain these results and that you need to consider before throwing a model at the problem.\n\nStart by looking at pairwise correlations between features. Think about how the correlations you see, both linear and nonlinear, may affect a predictive model, and think deeply about what the model training process is actually doing (i.e. what does collinearity do to coefficients in OLS? How does it affect different feature importance methods in tree models and how might the tree model training algorithm get biased in certain directions by features which share information?)\n\nYou can throw a model at a problem to get relatively good predictions as long as your data is relatively unchanging, but if you want to understand the model, you have to be **way** more careful and thoughtful about how you build it.",
            "You don\u2019t normally select regression models by comparing R Squared. It\u2019s not directly comparable anyway if your models are built differently. You might want to be looking at AIC values",
            "- tried linear regression (fitted many models and chose the best using the R squared adjusted, but the model was predicting an increase of \"y\" instead of a decrease)\n\nCheck to see if this is a case of Simpson's paradox. \n\nAlso: try making regression models with smaller subsets of features and seeing if the signs flip when you remove certain features from fitting.  If you do, then there's possibility of significant co-correlation.\n\nI would not concentrate on more complicated modeling technologies---other than generalized linear models (i.e. nonlinear monotonic transformations of individual features followed by an explicitly additive model).  Maybe the inclusion of the multiple correlated features with unexpected signs is to fit some feature-wise nonlinearity in a purely linear model.\n\nThe goal here is insight for management, and going down random forest and SHAP is in the opposite direction of what solves the problem for them.\n\nIn sum my suggestion:  Stepwise build a GLM.  Start with one feature at a time.  Add new ones stepwise (choose most predictive) and re-fit one at a time. Stop when something looks weird, and try to explain that.\n\nIf there is actual nonlinear pairwise behavior, figure out feature engineering to model that interaction alone and then include it in the GLM.\n\nThere may be something unexpected either in the data, or actually in real life.  If it's the last one, be prepared for some pushback, and think of additional tests and experiments that might be done to confirm if it's really true or not.  if it's real, it may be worth a policy or operational change.",

This means that there is no single value you can point to that says \"a 1 unit increase in X corresponds to some fixed increase in Y\".  \n\n\nYou can look at generating a partial dependence plot on your training data to see how the change in one variable is affecting the prediction when all other variables are held constant."

It's fairly well-studied, since it's quite common for naturally occurring data to only be labeled in the positive case.

The positive samples are just too rare, and the indicative patterns are too varied.\n\nMaybe start by taking your labeled fraud instances and trying to find some of those indicative patterns by hand and see if that corresponds to any interesting  clusterings or gradients in the labeled set. Then translate those patterns over to the unlabeled set and see what happens over there. Ideally you\u2019d find more examples, and ideally you\u2019d be able to say \u201cyeah, those events are definitely weird.\u201d\n\nIf that all checks out, then you can use those rules to define additional features.

Yes I used stata in grad school and learned SAS for three jobs.\n\nEverything you need is here : [https://stats.oarc.ucla.edu/sas/modules/](https://stats.oarc.ucla.edu/sas/modules/)\n\nThey also have lectures for STATA.SAS is really simple once you get the core ideas.  There is something called a DATA step, which is generally used to data manipulation, then proc \\_\\_\\_\\_. Procs are basically your commands to run regressions, or other modeling frame work, producing plots, running statitical  tests, producing sumamry\n\nThe reason SAS was popular is its SQL implementation. There is proc sql which basically allows you to do data manipulation using SQL instead of the data step. Depending on the task its much slower, but it allows easy integration in environments where your accessing data bases to assemble data. However, in general you should use data step when possible, because its faster. (Most  people working in SAS now a days don't this as they probably are trained in r/Python.).\n\nin general the syntax in SAS is a little bit more cumbersome to learn than STATA, but its actually a much more flexible statistical package. SAS can actually manipulate and store multiple data sets, while Stata was meant for single small sample data analysis.\n\nThere are plenty of guides and documents for SAS, because SAS spent enormous resources developing learning tools for their products.  It is going the way of the dinosaurs, but imo its much easier to transition from STATA to SAS than say STATA to python. The packages have similar aims, the error/debugging is similar.\n\nBest of luck.\n\nOne other tip. The best way to learn is just redo one of your stata projects in SAS. Make sure it involves merging and matching multiple data sets and actual data cleaning. Then do the analysis in two different ways. Do one set of analysis where you are only allowed to use SAS's data step to clean/assemble data.  Repeate the exact set of analysis only using PROC SQL. That exercise will get you comfortable.",

It's one of those things where it works until it doesn't.  You will eventually hit a wall where you're applying for more senior roles but your resume doesn't back it up because you haven't stayed long enough at any one place to gain the required \"senior\" experience.  \n\nIn general, job hopping IS the best way of increasing comp, but the time between jobs usually increases as you get older.",

My current one has been the longest I\u2019ve been in one place (7 years at a FAANG).\n\nJob hopping is an effective method of increasing your salary of at least 20%. But the issue in this job market is you definitely need more experience to compete with other candidates for that jump.",
            "I've worked at two places in my DS career, so take my advice for what you will. Spent 4 years at the first place, and over that time doubled my pay through stock appreciation and promotions. Moved to the second place for a 60% raise and now, two years later, expecting 50% more for the year than my starting offer here.\n\nThe best time, in my opinion, to job hop is right after a promotion. That is when you have generated the evidence that you're operating at a higher level, but your company is almost certainly underpaying you. So take the evidence you put in your promo case and put that in your resume along with your shiny new title, and shop that around.\n\nThe only reason I wouldn't leave after a promotion, especially as a junior person, is if you feel that you're on the fast track for the next promotion as well. You will still be underpaid, but you may be able to leverage that into a better long-term outcome by getting promoted fast and then switching jobs to reset your salary later to a higher number.",
            "I have always gotten a ~35% raise when switching companies. Compared to getting 2-5% raises annually when staying in the same role and a ~15% raise when getting a promotion. \n\nHowever, I\u2019m not a job hopper. I\u2019m about 20 years into my career and worked for 4 companies. (Although most of those companies went through mergers or acquisitions which felt like changing companies\u2026 without the pay bump lol.) It\u2019s already been mentioned that one downside of hopping too quickly is you might not be able to develop the type of solid experience that\u2019s necessary to move up a level. Things like really getting to know a business/industry well enough that you can lead end-to-end projects from identifying the opportunity to discovery to implementation to measuring results. \n\nBut on the flip side, staying in the same role for too long without a promotion or other way to show growth can also be a concern when looking for a new job. I think the sweet spot is 2-3 years in the same role. Once I get to that point without a plan to move up, I start looking elsewhere. Sometimes though the market sucks and/or it takes awhile to find a role that checks more good boxes than the role I\u2019m in. The further along you get in your career, the more likely it is you\u2019ve made your way to a great company and have good benefits and work/life balance and whatnot. It can be hard to find something truly better, so it\u2019s no longer worth hopping.",

Highly recommend getting such a deal. Better (mental) health also comes with reduced costs, so in a way it also 'pays more'.\n\nPlus having more time also allows for starting your own business which increases your pay/life satisfaction way more."

For a stationary (auto)covariance function, the AR process must be stationary as well.\n\nIn essense it's almost like questioning the central limit theorem for statistical inference - \"why do we need iid random variables? (i.e., random samples)\". Quick answer is that the theory says so, the longer answer can be found through diving into the mathematics behind it.\n\nFor seasonality, AR model's main limitation is that the differencing process removes trend and seasonality. Though there are modifications where hyperparameters are included to account for this - which is exactly what ARIMA and SARIMA do. ARIMA includes trend, and SARIMA accounts for trend and seasonality so the series doesn't need to be stationary.",

While there are many other features (about 20), I think that this would be a pretty useful feature to include in the model (just going off of domain knowledge here). There are three categories for this feature, with the most common category occurring about 60% of the time. As far as I'm aware, my main options are to:\n\n1. Drop the feature altogether\n2. Drop the rows where the feature is missing (losing about 20% of my dataset)\n3. Replace the na's with the most commonly occurring category\n\nTo be honest, I'm not thrilled with any of these options.

If it\u2019s not random, the potential drawback of 2 is you might be systematically eliminating a certain kind of training example, making your model unsuited for the prediction task.

This allows the model to assess the relationship between y values and missingness, which should improve your model performance if missingness is non-random. Note that this approach will not work for methods that assume independent variables are uncorrelated.",

I'd describe myself as an exceptional data engineer, and an average, but enthusiastically improving data scientist. To that end, I'm also in school working through a graduate program in data science (50% done). \n\nMy issue is that the better I get (at least on paper), the more people seem to criticize my analysis. There's many analysts at my office, but very few legitimate data science positions and I've had more than one good friend tell me that my analysis was too hard to understand. This always hits hard because I work very hard to be fair, honest, and understandable.\n\nI honestly don't know if I'm being needlessly complex (to show off), if I'm bad at explaining my analysis, or if I'm just talking in the wrong way to the wrong people. I will say that it absolutely could be an ego issue because I do often feel a strong need to differentiate myself from the growing BI community. \n\nIs this a common feeling/experience for new data scientists?  For those of you that are more experienced, when you are asked to analyze data for general consumption (for non engineers), do you dumb everything down and leave out the checks and validation that give you confidence in your answers? \n\nIf you are curious, this is probably a [decently representative project that I did for school](https://default.qc0qma7a4qq1g.us-east-2.cs.amazonlightsail.com/results).

Definitely still do all your validation and checks, but frankly people usually don\u2019t care. \n\nA great framework that I\u2019ve was starting to use more before I went on paternity leave is \u201cWhat, so what, now what\u201d. \u201cWhat\u201d is your observation, \u201cso what\u201d is the context and why it matters, \u201cnow what\u201d is your recommendations. Keep it succinct and relevant to whoever you\u2019re presenting to and dump all your extra material in an appendix for reference if needed.\n\nAs far as feedback goes, if a stakeholder sees a title like, \u201cComputational Data Analysis of Simulated FOQA Data\u201d you\u2019ve lost them already.",

You don't care how they come to it, how many studies were made or what the chemical composition of the drug is, or how it differentiates from an alternative drug. All you want is a piece of paper with a name and a brief explanation on how to take them.\n\nSame for business. No one cares about most of what we do. They only care if they need to impress a customer but even then they don't care but only want some fancy looking stuff. Our job is to do the research, and write the piece of paper with a solution. You are not dump if you don't want to dive into the chemical components of the prescribed drug, its just irrelevant to you. Same for business. Never ever use anything like the report you made in any presentation at a company. You will bore people to death with it and you will lose your audience. That's one of the most crucial things I had to learn. Always keep in mind who you are talking to and ask yourself why they listen to you. What do they want to take away from your report or presentation. Most of the time they will need to make some sort of decision. So build it around that. What is the problem they want to solve, what are the different solutions and what are the consequences of them according to your data. E.g. if they need to make the decision of they discontinue a product they don't care about plots and methodology and parameters used etc., those things do not contribute anything to the decision they need to make.\n\nPresentations and reports are universities and those in business are enormously different. When I started I absolutely hated them, funny little graphics, very little detail etc. Though most of them are rethorically much better than any university report or presentation and that's what it is about in the end. If you are not able to communicate your results clear and simple to your target audience it has no value.

It was a no fluff introduction to the algebra, calculus, linear algebra, statistics needed for basic DS. \n\nNow of course this book wouldn\u2019t make you a researcher, but it seemed like enough to be dangerous on the job as a product or analytics focused DS, before diving into math more deeply.",

Even though we know the authors attempt to explain concepts in plain language. \n\nThe problem, I think, lies in the examples used. The examples are not relatable to our daily life, which makes it hard to connect. \n\nFor example, we can use student exam scores (instead of a bunch of random numbers), to explain concepts like variance. By doing so, readers would be easier to understand and apply these concepts in their own projects",

You need to practice, and that\u2019s where I feel that self teaching might be a little bit short, compared to a university. At least that was my experience, Mathe courses I had in university led me to more practice. On the other hand, when learning by myself I invested more time In understand everything that is happening and less on practicing.",
            "I'm not familiar with that particular book, but my general thought is that there's nothing that replaces actually taking courses in the core subjects: Calculus I and II, Linear Algebra, and Probability and Stats. The two other lower division math courses (Calculus III and Ordinary Differential Equations) are not necessary. These can all be taken at a community college for relatively cheap (depending on the state) or even online for free through a MOOC will give more thorough treatment of the subject. While utility will depend on the quality of the instructor, in my experience some of the best math instructors I had were taken at a community college. \n\nAnyway, it's one thing to self-study through reading. But it's entirely different to actually test your knowledge through working through problem sets (and getting constructive feedback where necessary).",

Just thought I\u2019d mention because sometimes they have a title that sounds like a beginner text but they aren\u2019t. \n\nA cheap option that might work based on its contents is Freund Introduction To Probability available from Dover in a cheap edition (quite a few of the other Dover books on probability seem to be at the advanced measure theoretic level that you will be keen to avoid).\n\nThe standard ug probability curriculum is nearly as well covered as college calculus - there are probably dozens of textbooks, just type undergraduate probability into amazon (or google) and choose one where the author's style doesn't annoy you.",
            "Idk why they test on probability problems like that. You really don\u2019t need to know how to solve discrete probability problems to be a data scientist lmfao. How many balls and bins problems have you done as a data scientist, how many times have you had to code up a solution to a balls and bins problem at work? Lmfao. HR is retarded.",
            "You could go through the actuarial Probability exam sample questions online which comes with solutions.",
            "Most beginner's textbooks will do fine, for example Wackerly.",
            "Only thing that helped me was doing a ton of problems until it sank it. Schaum's Outline of Probability and Statistics was particularly helpful, you can probably order a used copy online for cheap, or find a pdf somewhere."

I'd also love to engage with people on the sub who'd like to share their data analyst career journey.\n\nSo, just a reminder that early stages vision is to become the #1 job board for data analysts - hand-picking interesting data analyst job opportunities across industries.\n\nLet's dive right in: \u00a0\n\n# Statistics update\n\n|\\-|January|February|March|April|May|June|July|\n|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|\n|Number of jobs posted|Total: 208 (US)|Total: 212 (US)|Total: 207 (US)|Total: 153 (US)|Total: 140 (US)|Total: 115 (US)|Total: 104 (US)|\n|Paid posts|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|\n|Visitors|795|3,267|3,003|4,892|5,203|4,029|3,382|\n|Apply now clicks|634|2,354|2,898|4,051|4,476|4,561|3,193|\n|Avg. session duration|3min 52sec|3min 53sec|3min 39sec|3min 44sec|3min 10sec|3min 17sec|3min 05sec|\n|Pageviews|4100|16,300|15,449|26,291|28,755|24,000|18,884|\n|Avg. time on page|1min 35sec|1min 46sec|1min 45sec|1min 39sec|1min 26sec|1min 26sec|1min 30sec|\n|Returning visitors|17.7%|22.4%|23.9%|23.8%|22.2%|22.5%|24.5%|\n|Google Impressions|503|5,500|9,430|28,300|45,900|58,100|47,500|\n|Google Clicks|47|355|337|1,880|2,070|3,320|2,180|\n|Newsletter subs (total)|205|416|600|918|1,239|1,431|1,559|\n|Newsletter open rate (48hrs)|61%|67%|56%|56%|52%|60%|Skipped|\n\n\u00a0\n\n# 1. General Observations\n\n## Stats\n\nDataAnalyst.com has been online for just over 7 months and we've brought over 1,500 hand curated data analyst jobs onto the site - all of them including a salary range.\u00a0\n\nThere's almost 1,600 people subscribed to the newsletter, and I can't thank you enough for your support and for joining us on the journey.\n\nFollowing the site traffic and visitors peak in April/May, there's been a noticeable drop on those metrics.\n\nIn the early days, I would be posting between 10 - 15 jobs daily, looking to brute-force the marketplace conundrum and bring initial traffic in. At the same time I knew this was not sustainable in the long run, particularly on the monetization front - if companies see jobs added by me for free, why would they engage themselves?\n\nSo for now, I'm attributing this dump in traffci to the decrease in number of job postings added daily to the site and potentially also the wide-spread summer slump - people taking time off, organizations are slowing down hiring (which I've also noticed when hand picking available roles) and overall, activity drops.\n\nThe decrease also goes hand in hand with decrease of social media posts on Twitter/Linked, leading to less social media traffic. I have however added new profile pages on Facebook and Instagram, similarly automating job postings there, so will see how those channels perform.\n\nWhile looking at the numbers go down isn't a pretty sight, I do believe that in combination with the organic traffic, it makes sense to have the (hopefully) short term dip, as it'll pave way for monetizing. Obviously this means there will be less jobs to apply to for now, but until I see steady inflow of company-posted jobs, I will not be looking to decrease the frequency / quality / quanity of listings any more.\n\nI've also spent some time last month using tools such as SEMRush / Ahrefs / Moz to run some high level audits and understand how the site performs on the SEO front. This led to a lot of time spent on making significant on-page changes to improve keyword optimisation, rewriting meta descriptions and adding alt descriptions to all the images on the site. This is probably something that could (and should) have been done a lot earlier, but oh well.\n\n## BusinessAnalyst.com\n\nSome of you may have noticed that I've also recently launched [BusinessAnalyst.com](https://bussinessanalyst.com) \\- where I'm looking to replicate step by step what I've done over the last 6 months with DataAnalyst. The overall idea is to create a network of sites, benefiting from the same infastructure, serving and helping different career paths, and making a collaboration with organisations much more appealing (afterall, most companies who hire for data analysts also look for business analysts and vice versa). Arguably, this might not make much sense seeing that DA still hasn't brought any revenue in, but on the other hand, I can reuse the whole tech stack and structures already in place, halve my cost per project, while doubling the surface area to catch me some luck.\n\nSeeing July has been the first full month of having the site up, I will be also documenting the journey and posting a progress update on appropriate subreddits.\n\n# 2. Expanding the data analyst salary guide\n\nWe are continuing on our mission to building out DataAnalyst.com - not just as a job board, but also as an educational hub - from interviews with experienced professional, best practices, to advice about getting into the industry.\n\nAs mentioned in my previous updates, there's been guides recently released.\n\n**How to become a data analyst guide** which covers topics such as:\n\n* understanding the role and responsibilities of a data analyst\n* becoming a data analyst, and what it obtains - from education, experience, to technical and soft skills\n* the well known not-so-secret hack - building your own portfolio\n* career development and salary guide (yes, our own!)\n\n[**The data analyst salary guide**](https://www.dataanalyst.com/salary-guide) \\- which provides the overview of salaries in various industries - and also shows a more detailed view on each industry page, with a deep dive into how much entry level, senior and lead data analysts can earn depending on their experience.\u00a0\n\nOver the course of last month I've been restructuring some of the ways I collect and store data about available job roles, and I was able to expand the data analyst salary guide beyond just industry - now also detailing **data analyst salaries across different states in the US.**\n\nNow, as it usually is with this kind of exercise, lumping the data all together you come up with an insane range. On the other hand, if you split the data in 52 different ways, you'll get a whole different set of issues where N is not large enough to draw any conclusions - and for some states, there's simply no data at all.\n\nAs the site grows, and the number of jobs on the site increases, I do however believe that I'll be able to bring an addition source of information about salaries, complimenting those already available on other sites.\n\nFor the US, we've also released the July edition of Market Insights, you can see the full report in the blog section on the site as well.\n\n# What's currently on my mind (random musings)\n\n**Re: Newsletter** \\- when starting, I wanted the newsletter to be sent on a weekly basis, containing the latest jobs. The more I thought about it, the more I became against the idea - afterall, people could visit the site and see, why spam their emails? At the same time, the point of the site is to help people find a role - once they would, they wouldn't really need weekly emails with latest jobs.\n\nI was recently able to implement better tracking of job views - how many people have viewed which job post. It may be that I could use this data to send a weekly \"hottest data analyst jobs on the plafrom for the last week\" - however, to do so, I believe I need to include segmentation into my email list i.e people looking for a job will receive these, whilst others would be able to opt out. This will require some restructuring of the current newsletter onboarding flow, but that's probably better to be done sooner, rather than later.\n\n**Re: Improving site experience** \\- I go through every single comment I receive on Reddit, and there's been a few in the last month or two, highlighting some inconsistencies in terms of UX/UI experience across mobile/table/desktop versions. I've spent some time over the last few weeks to address some of those bugs, discovered a whole bunch more, and have been fixing them one by one. I do want the site to be easy to use, with consistent styling and experience - so, if you come across bugs, please just let me know :)\n\n# Things in the pipeline\n\n* New data analyst jobs, added daily\n* Actually launching the weekly newsletter with the pick of best jobs directly to your inbox (yes, I know...., but...above...)\n* Monthly US data analyst market insights\n* Improving the overall site experience (this one is a never ending activity)\n* Continuing to bring you Data Analysts across their experience levels, to share tips, tricks and their thoughts\n\n# 3 ways you could help\n\n1. Looking for a new challenge? Check out the website - I'm adding new jobs daily\n2. Looking to hire a data analyst to your team? Do you know anyone looking to hire? Shoot me a message on Reddit (or [alex@dataanalyst.com](mailto:alex@dataanalyst.com)) and I'll upgrade your first listing for free!\n3. As I mentioned, we have an ongoing \"Day of a Data Analyst\" series. For those of you who are open to do an email based interview about your data analyst career journey, please just send me a message and we'll organise something - would love to get you featured and share your experience with our readers!\n\nIf you have any questions, concerns, come across glitches - please just reach out, happy to chat.\n\nThank you all again, and see you in a month.\n\nAlex",

            "I think BI is hard to evaluate because it's hitting a bit of a \"day of reckoning\". \n\nBI used to be an incredibly critical function because it owned reporting. So back in a day where it was hard to build all inclusive tools, you just needed to get massive amounts of data to lots of different people from a ton of systems, and it was BIs job to make sure they could facilitate that. \n\nThen came dashboards, and the BIG move in the IT world was to just turn everything into a dashboard. This coincided with the idea of self-service analytics, and so you ended up seeing configurable reporting tools (e.g., Business Objects) and dashboards all become extremely popular all at once.\n\nHere's the issue: just making more data available for people to use does not ensure value. And when it gets easier to *ask* for data, what ends up happening is that everyone spends all their time asking for more data, drowning their BI teams in data requests. But none of those people are ever held accountable for whether or not that data is useful, or helpful, or whether it actually helps the company make more money.\n\nAnd to me, that is the day of reckoning for BI. BI needs to evolve from just giving data back to people into a function that builds tools. I've seen modern organizations make that transition, and that work is, to me, very interesting. But BI organizations that are stuck in the Tableau + Reporting world? That stuff is soul crushing.",
            "I used to be a data scientist on a BI team. A BI team can spend a lot of time on data engineering tasks like ETL generating tables, then reporting out to the business using dashboards.\n\nMy biggest gripe has nothing to do with BI itself, but usually the stakeholders. I sat in many meetings where everyone talked about sales numbers without context for those numbers. Often they'd want to compare to a finance model for targets, or the year over year sales. What they lacked was context on if the numbers they talked about were important or just noise.\n\nI would include confidence intervals in any dashboard I could. Often this required doing some bootstrapping to get the confidence intervals, followed by jumping through hoops to draw them on dashboarding software.\n\nOften the business isn't technical, I just wish I could have removed the prediction lines and only communicated the confidence bands to boot them out of their way of thinking. So often meetings could feel like setting fire to thousands of dollars in lost productivity as a sales leader handwove an excuse on why sales were 4% lower than expected in a noisy industry.",

Imo a lot of value comes not from \"insights\" but actually automating what your decision-makers do (e.g., procurement). For this to happen you need ML + engineering time.\n\nData doesn't start and stop with things that fit into a data warehouse either. I've done several meaningful and fun work projects centered around computer vision (think stuff related to social distancing).\n\nFinally, a big part of BI is front-end type stuff. I can't design pretty looking things even if my life depended on it. I can tell a story with data but sometimes BI goes too deep into UI/UX which is definitely valuable but I don't really have the talent nor interest for.",

Explain what the experimentation phase likely will look like, e.g. : \"I need 4-6 weeks for this experimentation phase. The outcome / deliverable should be an shared understanding of the project outline and its scope that will allow us to start the project. Depending on your feedback and on whether complications come up, we can extend the experimentation phase jointly.\u00a0\n\n\nI'll also explain the technical stuff and I'll do the leg work and will develop the specific requirements together.\u00a0We'll also define the milestones together along the way at specific points further down the road and when and where necessary. From your side I need the business input, so I need someone who I can come to with questions and who can take the time to\u00a0clarify any busines-related (design) questions. Some answers I might have, some you might have, everything else we develop together.\"\n\n\nYou can agree on deliverables and a 'definition of done' for this phase, you can agree whether there's any cutoff points.

They don't know yet what the product should look like, they don't know how your colleague works, they don't know whether there's budget questions down the road or whether there's any organisational complications.\n\n\nThey may or may not have an understanding of some of that but at the end they have a business need and a big uncertainty in their mind. And the most approachable way to reduce this uncertainty is to give it a timeframe (which a more experienced colleague may or may not have been able to give). The point here is you can't, in good conscience, give that timeline at this point in time - and that's okay\n\n\n\nYour task now is to reduce this uncertainty in the best way possible. If you can't give a timeframe, then don't - you're not doing anyone any favours if you do, neither yourself nor your stakeholders.\nOne way to do it is to give the project more structure (see my writings above):\n\n\n- tell them what the issues are (e.g. can't define timeline unless X is given)\n\n\n- break it down into small, reversible steps (e.g. do experimentation, then reassess. Depending on outcome can then do more experimentation or\u00a0development or scrap it)\n\n\n- involve them and make your expectations clear (responsibilities on the business side by like answering your questions).\n\n\nUsually, people will be okay with that kind of structure in lieu of a timeline, it may even be welcomed\u00a0as a more realistic approach (I mean how many deadlines have they seen\u00a0that weren't met? \ud83d\ude09).\u00a0\n\n\nIt gives people a defined level of control and a clear path forward\u00a0 - which is all anyone can ask for, really.\u00a0Plus, you're managing expectations while also only giving assurances on things\u00a0which you know you can deliver on - this naturally will be very broad deliverables at first, and you'll narrow these down together with the business colleagues along your collaboration.",

        "content": "My current position is Senior Data Scientist, it is my second role, before that I was a DS consultant and I have about 4-5 yoe, depends on you count it. \n\nI have been working at my current place for about 2 years, and I got to the point where my learning is bounded. I am very appreciated at my current workplace, and I had the luck of entering to the company at a good time, so I took part in the development of several central pipelines, and saw our product become profitable. For the past six months, however, I have been feeling stuck and frustrated. Due to bad management we are now micro-managed by our CEO. It doesn't look like I have a lot of place to grow, and my direct manager isn't at a point he can guild me on ML and has a very modest technical stack to be generous. \n\nFor the past year, I started to develop interest in NLP, and since then I did on my spare time a lot of learning and some side project in varying complexity. In my work as well, I was able to push for using some of the things that I learned (also by doing extra hours, but it was for me as well). So far I led a project were we trained a RoBERTa model from scratch, including tokenization as we deal with somewhat a different domain than the off-the-shelf pre-trained datasets are familiar with. I also trained more modest models including siamese network to learn similarity between strings of different sources, and a Word2Vec for word embeddings when the use case made more sense than using contextual embeddings. All of the above are projects that ended up being delivered to customers, which I led from a-z.\n\nI know that in four months or so, I would like to start looking for a new place, and I know that I am looking for a place where I could deepen my knowledge about working with textual data. In the meantime I am trying to read as many papers as my time allows (both inside and outside of work), and I try to look for problems I can solve with NLP in my current workplace. Our main product is based on classification and we are heavily focus on low latency, so with these two limitations, I am struggling to see how transformer decoders (LLMs) can help. \n\nI don't know if the above would suffice to land a first job as an NLP engineer/DS in a company that focuses on textual data. **I am wondering what can I do in order to set myself apart from other candidates, and what hiring managers in such companies look for in a prospective candidate**. \n\nThanks!",

DS has (had?) a reputation for being just really brainy people that can think about really complex stuff better than other people. In practice, it\u2019s more about leveraging technology to make better decisions faster. A lot of that work gets mundane after a while.

            "I agree with you. I believe it's the cloud providers that are responsible for this shift. Typically the people making strategic decisions for a company are the CTO, some skilled engineers under him/her, and the board members/CFO later approving it based on some financial projections. While the Data Science organization has started to grow in many companies, we are nowhere near having Data Scientist being actually part of making large-scale decisions for companies. \n\nSo the people making decisions have both engineering and financial competence. The cloud providers have specifically targetted these two areas in the products they're developing and have made vast efforts to reach out to leaders within companies with AI capabilities in order to sell their new vision. According to them, the automated frameworks for MLops and even model training (like AutoML) they have developed provides us with a way to solve ten usecases in the time it previously took to solve one. From both an engineering and a financial perspective, this is an amazing new way to get value out of data science products. Everything we have to do is to identify a metric, and then rely on AutoML, effectively turning the entire problem into a simple implementation job with minimal DS competence required which allows us to scale like never before.\n\nSo why is this bad? The issues arrive when we need to have more insight into our models. AutoML is particularly evil in this sense in that it doesn't even let you inspect the actual model. You're supposed to blindly rely on the predictions of a hidden model that's been optimized by a framework which you have no insight into. When the solution inevitably makes a mistake or provides a crazy prediction and business runs over asking what happened, you will have no way of explaining to them what went wrong.",
            "Nobody wants to deploy some weakly validated and badly coded mess of a model. Deploying models is a niche and it pays very well but it has a high barrier of entry because scale is what and quality is valued and deploying a bad model is just scaling up your company losing money",

Once done, it needs a production pipeline and a simple stable model to start delivering money. Later, you either advance for a fraction of the remaining 25% or chase the next opportunity.\nI guess what you are describing is a result of an improved effort-performance signal backpropagation within the ML-reliant industry. The decade of ML POC flow has trained a generation of managers.\n\nI've seen the ML research-oriented approach in unique hard-to-formulate cases with ambitious objectives, but these were fairly few in my practice.",

            "It's kind of a wide topic. From the pure data standpoint, my experience is that baseline fraud detection consists of looking at value\u00a0distributions within your data to establish a baseline for \"normal\" data, then look for cuts of data that exhibit suspiciously anomalous distributions relative to the normal. For example, say your contractors' reports include collection timestamps, and you look at the distribution of time of collection, for some contractors you might find super spiky collection times implying they're collecting 100 responses in 2 minutes and then nothing for the rest of the day whereas most other contractors' responses are spread over the day. So you can sort of generalize this by coming up with signals (eg time of collection binned by hour) and cuts (contractor id) then watching for any outliers. ML can work but by definition it needs to see fraud in order to learn to recognize it. I've seen it used more to prevent recurrence than to do initial detection. Because fraud detection is adversarial, it tends to constantly require novel analysis (if you knew how to identify fraud, you'd have already blocked it before it even occurred)",

Models even agreed with blatantly false math claims if the user signaled agreement. Analyzing three sycophancy tasks showed model size and instruction tuning increased this behavior. A simple synthetic data intervention was proposed, fine-tuning models to strengthen resistance to freely available opinions. This reduced sycophantic behavior, especially on new prompts.*\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**Why does it matter?**\n\n* Bigger isn't always better: Larger LLMs displayed more sycophantic behavior, suggesting scale alone won't solve this issue. Instruction tuning also increased sycophancy.\n* Social grounding requires care: Humans operate within shared social frames of reference. Simulating social dynamics for AI comes with risks if models lack proper grounding in facts/logic.\n* More work to be done: Simple solutions like synthetic data fine-tuning are promising starting points, but comprehensively addressing problematic behaviors like sycophancy will require more sophisticated solutions.\n\nCredit for the summary goes to\u00a0[this AI newsletter](https://www.tomorrownow.tech/)\n\nAnd here's the full\u00a0[research paper](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2308.03958.pdf) from Google Deepmind",

Any software company that needs to manage a lot of data would benefit from a dedicated DE/team.\n\nEdit: I wouldn\u2019t worry about having a 1 to 1 degree. Two of our top DSs have unrelated degrees. I\u2019m not sure about our DE team. I\u2019m a SWE with an unrelated degree. Sure a STEM degree helps and is probably preferred by most, but what matters more is that you understand the theories behind good DE practices (or whatever CS related job you\u2019re going for) and are familiar with the tools your prospective employer currently uses.",
            "Even if the hype dies down, if you are already in the industry I don't see how can this ever be a problem for you. Your years of experience will only grow and make you more valuable, you don't have to worry about people competing for junior DS positions.\n\nDo the move if you are interested in DE, but don't do it if is only out of fear.",

        "content": "Hello beautiful Reddit community \n\nI would like to put you in a bit of context about my case and see if you can help me, I would be eternally grateful. \n\nWell, I'm a 28 year old chemical engineer, currently not working in the field I study (My programming skills are not the best, but I practice almost every day).\n\nI have been working as a credit analyst for almost 3 years, but I got desperate to grow since you have to be friends with the senior manager. \n\n So I have decided to create a path in the data world and become a data analyst as soon as I had the knowledge requested. \n\nThis is something I was itching with curiosity since 1 year approx. So since then I have been self taught with Python, but of course I know this is not enough.\n\nSo I have asked for information about some bootcamps in my country, but in my opinion, these are quite expensive and not recognized enough that another bootcamp in another country might have. \n\nYesterday I saw a post where a guy was asking for help for a good example of bootcamp, and someone answered that Great Learning with MIT bootcamps collaboration is a very good option. So I had my interview a few minutes ago and the prices are not that expensive and it's close to my budget. \n\n So I am here entirely asking for your help and advice you could give me and if you recommend me which bootcamp or if you have another option it will be well appreciated. \n\nThanks in advance!",

            "No for the boot camp. Those are money grabs. I\u2019d say if you want a career boost / switch into data, do a masters in data analytics at a reputable university.",
            "I don't know about any other boot camps but do avoid Great Learning. I encountered them as well during my own search, and almost signed with them.\n\nBut I knew there was something fishy/off, so I dug into it a lot more. It sounds amazing on paper but the truth is they use a lot of unethical sales techniques, such as trying to qualify prospects for their ability to enroll in the course, but they let *anyone* (who can pay) join. I dug for reviews and all the positive reviews are very superficial and harp on the same points. I'm pretty sure they were paid reviews.\n\nThe only reviews that didn't sound like they were paid were negative, and you can find them on reddit.",
            "If you've already been working as a credit analyst and using Python, my thoughts are that a bootcamp will be less useful for you while being expensive. I would also be wary of these 'school' affiliated bootcamps, even something like UC Berkeley's MSDS is farmed out to staff that aren't part of the normal school. These are programs run by for-profit programs, and usually aren't actually affiliated with the schools/classes/faculty you would expect of MIT or UC Berkeley's CS department.\n\nI would recommend looking into the OMSA program at Georgia Tech if you're going down this route. It will also cost less than a bootcamp (12K for the degree), and is fully online, but it does reflect a bit of the 'self-taught' kind of mentality to be that much cheaper. The core classes are good, and the CS classes taught by actual Georgia Tech faculty, though your contact with them is usually limited, and you usually speak with TA's instead who can be hit or miss. You are also given very limited support by the school, and classes are somewhat designed with a sink or swim mentality. You either put in the work to learn and understand the concepts, or you fail.\n\nThat said, a bootcamp will generally give you a more focused/hands-on approach. You're paying to grind full-time. The pay-offs are questionable though as the field is saturated with bootcamp graduates, and most bootcamps are full-time.",

Recently I had done this with Bayesian statistics, through the book Bayesian data analysis by Andrew Gelman. \n\nNow that this chapter is complete, I look to a newer area, into the branch of statistics known as causal inference. Everyone has their own interpretation of causality. What framework is more useful for them. Rubin vs Pearl, etc. \n\nI find these debates to not be conducive to the real goal, and so I don\u2019t want anything like this in this discussion post.\n\nI would like however, to hear some instances where you guys are leveraging causal inference  \nIn your day to day, and more importantly the areas of business where causality and causal inference could be a potential goal for businesses to gain more insights. \n\nSome ideas that come to mind is in experimentation. Can we leverage these causal inference methodologies to improve in marketing analytics?

It was not possible to run experiments and we only had observational data. Causal inference gave me a good framework to answer questions like this. \n\nFor our CRM/CVM we can use it instead of having supervised models. However, it's a bit tricky and when searching for answers to some of our specific problems I literally found one researcher in the world that has tried to solve very similar problems to what we face.\n\nI believe that causal inference is very useful and from my point of view, more exciting than generative AI.",
